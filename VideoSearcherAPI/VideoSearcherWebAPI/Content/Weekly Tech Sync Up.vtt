00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:05.418
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/14-0
00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:08.508
I guess it is recording right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/21-0
00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:10.408
Yeah, yeah, that's correct.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/18-0
00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:09.398
Yep.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/26-0
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.548
Yeah, go ahead.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/28-0
00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:14.608
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/70-0
00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:20.046
Also, I am preparing a something
that's like it has like a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/70-1
00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:23.504
different uh like versions name
with different thing like

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/70-2
00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.260
sunwell is also known as we do
22 S 2 nickel and it has like a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/59-0
00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:27.168
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/70-3
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.598
client versions available but
server is in development.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/81-0
00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:32.708
That I've done this for all.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/80-0
00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:32.388
Gotcha. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/85-0
00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:34.248
Great.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/101-0
00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:37.467
Maybe if there's someone new
come he will not get so much

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/113-0
00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:41.218
Yeah. Yeah. I also do not know
this. This message is pretty.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/101-1
00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:38.028
confused.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/136-0
00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:45.784
Yeah, like in FTE, I think we
are all have only server in TH

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/136-1
00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:49.870
one only client. These we have
all both versions. So these are

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/131-0
00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:47.868
That's it, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/136-2
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.518
the names.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/145-0
00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:54.198
And and some tips and tricks
that I, uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/197-0
00:00:56.058 --> 00:01:00.020
The that I initially got
confused during this while doing

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/197-1
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.186
this MSRC so like before running
because we have to set this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/156-0
00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:00.848
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/197-2
00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:08.626
things on and binary we can use
this sign command. But once this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/197-3
00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:12.656
signs sign command was not
working like it was not signing

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/197-4
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.978
the binary. So I used sign
tools.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/232-0
00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:19.671
And we have to like set us
signing on from admin mode and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/232-1
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:23.802
some other things like uh, a
resale dot CMD we can run only

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/232-2
00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:28.070
from a command prompt, not from
like PowerShell. So these few

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/232-3
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.928
pitfalls that you can fall.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/236-0
00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:31.908
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/250-0
00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:36.208
So for for I guess PowerShell
there is a rather dot PS1.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/280-0
00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:40.462
PS1, PS One, yeah, yeah. But
from Rs one to download, let

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/280-1
00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:43.788
from downlevel platforms, it's
not, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/284-0
00:01:41.898 --> 00:01:45.028
There's no no PS1, right? Right.
Yeah, true.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/295-0
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.978
So all these things are I'm what
I encountered so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/298-0
00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:49.948
Yeah, good, good.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/300-0
00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:50.808
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/318-0
00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:54.890
You can like share the link in
case you want and we can like

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/314-0
00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:55.368
Ah yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/318-1
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.938
put it in in the chair. Yeah.
Cool.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/335-0
00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:01.858

vibranium real element or not.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/344-0
00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:08.958
I guess it's just that wrong
that Marvel movies.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/350-0
00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:10.688

OK. OK. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/493-0
00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:32.579
I, Derrick, I guess some direct

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.424
recall the complete name, but
direct something is like yeah

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/440-0
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:34.858
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/445-0

00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:40.525
and and it's number is 420. So
I'm not sure if anybody is aware

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/493-3
00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:44.498

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.279
this the real element? So he
told him no, it's it's just a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/493-5
00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.778
fictional word that he has

So actually this is a very good
uh guide. So it has like all the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/837-1
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.358
different here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/839-0
00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:02.478

No. OK, very.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/850-0
00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:05.368
How to create a DTP request?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/853-0
00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:06.688
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/861-0
00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:07.608
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/870-0
00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:12.238
So it has this link to this page
also this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/873-0
00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:13.328
Where did you find this?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/885-0
00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:19.448
I search from like this, uh,
from here and elsewhere.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/889-0
00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:21.208
Pull from boys. Derrick. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/907-0
00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:26.267
Yeah, actually I've been using
this for like many things. Uh,

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/907-1
00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:30.438
for, like, setting up this
source depot and all that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/912-0
00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:31.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/913-0
00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:31.878
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/918-0
00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:33.968
So it's very helpful.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/920-0
00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:35.968
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/969-0
00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:41.663
So here we can put our bug bug
ID so it will fetch everything

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/931-0
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:40.488
Mm-hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/969-1
00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:46.666
from this VSO like on the case
for my MSRC. Then we can select

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/969-2
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:51.670
a product. Let's say I'm working
for RS5 and we can put in the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/969-3
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.688
kbid. Now KB ID we can get from
that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/983-0
00:05:54.768 --> 00:06:00.749
Yeah, there's a that tool. So
the package ID, for example this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/974-0
00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:56.558
That.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/983-1
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:01.128
RS5.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/991-0
00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:04.168
I'll just fight.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1004-0
00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:08.038
OK. BID OK we can obtain from
Gray matter also, right or no?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1027-0
00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:11.948
OK VKB ID. I thought I don't
think you can obtain from Gray

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1027-1
00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:13.768
metric that knowledge base ID.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1030-0
00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:14.928
Correct. Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1043-0
00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:19.428
OK. So you are saying that it we
can get it from that tool?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1035-0
00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:16.528
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1071-0
00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:23.722
Yeah, because when your package
is built, it generates a like

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1071-1
00:06:23.722 --> 00:06:27.078
knowledge base ID. This so my
this KVR tickle is this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1070-0
00:06:25.288 --> 00:06:26.918
Ohk OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1077-0
00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:28.778
OK. OK. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1078-0
00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:28.538
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1089-0
00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:31.651
So I guess for like updated
change we have to use this you

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1089-1
00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:31.928
know.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1099-0
00:06:32.048 --> 00:06:34.528
OK, you are not able to. Are you
able to say this?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1094-0
00:06:32.648 --> 00:06:32.948
Good.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1106-0
00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:35.648
Yeah, we we can see it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1141-0
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:40.698
Yeah, yeah, no, but I actually
regret so here, that KB article

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1115-0
00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:37.118
You can see the.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1114-0
00:06:36.568 --> 00:06:37.358
Earlier also.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1141-1
00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:46.041
that comes in that I don't know
after the build, but I think in

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1141-2
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.378
the one that goes into this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1155-0
00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:53.738
Oh oh, link is a dummy when I
don't think it is the one that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1168-0
00:06:52.618 --> 00:06:57.605
Yeah, so ideally the KB article
should be, you know, captured

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1161-0
00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:54.788
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1168-1
00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:58.328
from the.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1181-0
00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:02.638
A group item group work item for
the MSRC.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1182-0
00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:03.278
Yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1194-0
00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:08.048
OK, OK, actually I I use this
one.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1203-0
00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:10.267
But I think this is a
placeholder so it works also I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1203-1
00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:10.548
mean.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1205-0
00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:10.868
Uh-huh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1210-0
00:07:12.258 --> 00:07:13.628
So I insert this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-0
00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:17.576
The poor little something like
this. So since these are private

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-1
00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:21.263
package I use for private for
testing in this sheet they are

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-2
00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:25.010
mentioned that you can mention a
private for if you are doing

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-3
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.878
private testing. But if you are
doing like official MSU package

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-4
00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:32.565
that is that LNU package or some
other package after they're

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1259-5
00:07:32.565 --> 00:07:34.378
generated that you can use no.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1269-0
00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:37.828
Uh, so the difference?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1262-0
00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:36.228
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1307-0
00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:40.434
So what? So sorry, sorry to
interrupt you. Right. So sorry.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1279-0
00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:40.888
Uh-huh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1307-1
00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:44.296
Sure. Ashwini, can you clear one
thing? So for this KB idea, I I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1307-2
00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:47.861
suppose this KB ID should map to
the current changes or the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1307-3
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:50.238
changed file that we have built,
right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1316-0
00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:53.028
Otherwise, how would it test on
the latest?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1322-0
00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:55.918
It should, so it should map to
the.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1345-0
00:07:56.318 --> 00:07:59.595
Uh to the release KB article
that is there and that is, I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1345-1
00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.589
think, uh. Written in like
Sourish said that will be

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1345-2
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:04.058

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1385-0
00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:08.015
Yeah, got it. But if if that is
the case, so but we want to run

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1356-0
00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:05.698
So that is.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1385-1
00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:11.403
this on our changes, right, the
changes that we have done the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1372-0
00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:11.158
Yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1385-2
00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:14.900
fix, so how will that will will
that come in the latest stages,

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1385-3
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.228
is it?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1389-0
00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:18.268
Uh, Rick?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1397-0
00:08:17.978 --> 00:08:21.118
That I think rigved can answer
because.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1398-0
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:21.218
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1399-0
00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:21.408
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1405-0
00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:23.278
So how do we?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1417-0
00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:26.968
I actually let me open open that
task group.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1410-0
00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:24.598
Yeah. Tell me.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1444-0
00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:32.917
No, no. So from the bug ID to it
can take right? Because in the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1422-0
00:08:28.248 --> 00:08:28.758
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1444-1
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:35.728
bug we are whenever we are
pushing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1464-0
00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:39.351
Private private testing actually
is not dependent on TV ID. You

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1449-0
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:37.798
But.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1464-1
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:42.158
just give it to me when that
will work.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1460-0
00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:40.598
Ah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1485-0
00:08:50.018 --> 00:08:50.558
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1504-0
00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:54.519
Changes have been to that
specific AB ID for private. I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1504-1
00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:57.555
think it can work because
anyways they are different. TBD

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1504-2
00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:58.758
for different packages.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1526-0
00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:04.010
OK, so basically from the bug ID
only it will sing the PR right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1526-1
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.638
Or the code changes is it?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1537-0
00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:09.568
Actually we are providing it
that package also. So I will

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1537-1
00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:10.038
show you.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1543-0
00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:11.518
At church church.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1556-0
00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:15.131
So I yeah, so I actually we are
providing the whole package

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1556-1
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:17.258
this, this, this dad package.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1564-0
00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:21.688
So we are providing it a whole
this thing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1567-0
00:09:22.318 --> 00:09:23.198
This installer.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1569-0
00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:24.428
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1578-0
00:09:24.478 --> 00:09:27.218
So it doesn't matter. It will
take all the updates from this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1580-0
00:09:28.028 --> 00:09:28.388
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1623-0
00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:37.284
Yeah, so after this, we can.
Yeah. So if you you are selected

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1623-1
00:09:37.284 --> 00:09:41.787
is private, the options are
disabled. Now you can save

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1623-2
00:09:41.787 --> 00:09:46.536
request and run AB ABS test
selection. So in this sheet I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1623-3
00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:50.138
they're mentioned that so it
will identify.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-0
00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:54.804
Of like from from this thing I
think from this information they

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-1
00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:59.019
will identify where the code
changes are done like in which

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-2
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:03.444
area are done will take a test
accordingly like for example my

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-3
00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:07.519
changes are done in register
area it will take like sorry

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-4
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:12.084
base area register area it will
take those tests accordingly. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-5
00:10:12.084 --> 00:10:16.721
it will take some time like 5-10
minutes it takes around. So I'll

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1729-6
00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.898
show from here my previous one.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1763-0
00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:32.188
And also it depends on which
version we are running. For

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1763-1
00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:38.914
example in this PR I think
RS5RS5 it took only 10 tests but

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1763-2
00:10:38.914 --> 00:10:43.398
in this Rs one it took around 26
tests.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1818-0
00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:48.000
And some were like client
version tests somewhere else.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1818-1
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.391
Someone somewhere like a server
version test and different test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1818-2
00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:56.575
in 1920 took around like 41
tests. So it also depends on the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1818-3
00:10:56.575 --> 00:11:00.348
version that you are testing. So
here is a total jobs.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1828-0
00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:11.658
So these are all the test it
used.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1862-0
00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:20.655
OK, so you can see here this
enterprise version like client

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1862-1
00:11:20.655 --> 00:11:24.502
version around four test and
other versions are. So it

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1862-2
00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:28.839
mentioned that these are server
test kind of also. So it will

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1862-3
00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:29.888
take some time.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1867-0
00:11:32.128 --> 00:11:33.748
There is that, huh?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1907-0
00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:38.384
This this is in progress. It
will take some time. So after

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1907-1
00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:42.302
that in the in next step what we
do it asks us to provide a this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1907-2
00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:45.858
this package version. So where
we have to put this package

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1907-3
00:11:45.858 --> 00:11:48.028
version we have to put inside
this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1909-0
00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:48.438
The.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1966-0
00:11:57.468 --> 00:12:02.050
So here is a this will this path
we have to provide a private

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1966-1
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.633
packages inside this and we have
to give this link we have to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1966-2
00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:11.510
copy this link and put it inside
that that that input field which

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1966-3
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.019
we have given. So to put here
you have to gain access from a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/1966-4
00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:17.718
DLL. So this is the DL.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2001-0
00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:29.743
Yeah. So it does, Vin XCX. FT
Group is a group in ID web that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2001-1
00:12:29.743 --> 00:12:33.648
you have to take permission from
and after they have given

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2001-2
00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:37.488
permission then you can insert
this your file inside this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2001-3
00:12:37.488 --> 00:12:40.268
folder and then you can start to
testing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2004-0
00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:43.398
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2009-0
00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:45.138
Yeah. Yeah, so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2011-0
00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:45.858
Hello my boss.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2019-0
00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:49.048
I'll be time over book.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2075-0
00:12:49.438 --> 00:12:54.227
This is my my thing. So you have
to you have to be like specific

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2030-0
00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:51.798
Umm, let me.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2075-1
00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:59.090
you have to put inside R5 folder
for RS5. This is my KB ID and 64

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2075-2
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.658
you have to type in 64 if you
don't if you don't directly put

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2075-3
00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:08.226
your that package file here not
inside the 64 it will show an

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2075-4
00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:08.668
error.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2097-0
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:13.364
In this uh DTP page itself, so
you have to put inside this and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2097-1
00:13:13.364 --> 00:13:17.246
then you have to take its path
and you have to paste there.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2097-2
00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:18.798
After that it will work.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2102-0
00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:27.038
These are on the different.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2118-0
00:13:28.258 --> 00:13:33.908
Of urgent where for RS5? These
are the different KB ID.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2120-0
00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.068
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2128-0
00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:54.098
Yeah, that's all I think.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2142-0
00:13:58.658 --> 00:14:01.794
OK. I guess Ashwini you got
actually my connection broke in

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2142-1
00:14:01.794 --> 00:14:03.728
between. So you got the steps
right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2179-0
00:14:04.688 --> 00:14:09.067
Yeah, most of them, I got like
the I have, I have a few doubts

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2158-0
00:14:07.148 --> 00:14:08.258
OK. OK, fine.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2179-1
00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:13.446
I think but those since we have
regret now then we can ask him

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2179-2
00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:14.558
whenever needed.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2198-0
00:14:14.018 --> 00:14:18.551
Yeah, yeah. So once we are like
doing it, no. Yeah, we can ask

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2184-0
00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:15.908
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2186-0
00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:16.248
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2202-0
00:14:17.628 --> 00:14:19.758
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2198-1
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:18.838
him.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2201-0
00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:19.788
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2210-0
00:14:20.808 --> 00:14:22.238
OK. Thanks Rick with.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2209-0
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:22.048
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2212-0
00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:23.658
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2229-0
00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:28.718
So I think I can talk about that
RPC legacy test failure.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2216-0
00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:24.468
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2219-0
00:14:24.388 --> 00:14:24.888
Welcome.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2233-0
00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:30.558
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2239-0
00:14:30.018 --> 00:14:32.348
Uh, yes. Sure. Please.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2254-0
00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:36.195
We were spending, I mean that
was due for some time, right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2245-0
00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:33.908
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2255-0
00:14:35.778 --> 00:14:36.558
Right, right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2254-1
00:14:36.195 --> 00:14:36.398
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2295-0
00:14:37.368 --> 00:14:43.108
OK. So yeah, so as we know that
we own the RPC framework for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2295-1
00:14:43.108 --> 00:14:48.660
this. So whenever there is a
whenever we are like shipping

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2295-2
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.024
for MSRC, so it is also like our
job because we own that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2295-3
00:14:54.024 --> 00:14:56.658
component, it is our job to.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2313-0
00:14:57.388 --> 00:15:03.231
Uh, basically monitor if there
are any major test failures. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2313-1
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.178
I think in in for 9B.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2315-0
00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:06.578
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-0
00:15:07.968 --> 00:15:12.655
Also added nine bids right now
for 8B. That is in August. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-1
00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:17.111
that time we got we observed
certain MTP test failure. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-2
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.798
like DTP required if you're
specially for you, if you're not

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-3
00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:26.561
aware, MTP is the monthly test
pass that is like whole in you

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-4
00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:30.633
can say unit testing plus
integration testing of all

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-5
00:15:30.633 --> 00:15:35.243
components across Windows and
everything. So there are some

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2380-0
00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:33.788
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2392-6
00:15:35.243 --> 00:15:39.238
legacy tests that are that have
been written since.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2399-0
00:15:39.598 --> 00:15:41.768
This are busy component was
written.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2427-0
00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:46.014
So we observed that in one of
the test suits it was a test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2427-1
00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:49.426
suit of nine tests we were
observing that seven of them

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2427-2
00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:50.218
were failing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2458-0
00:15:50.838 --> 00:15:55.410
So now this is this becomes like
an emergency. Why? Because since

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2458-1
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.288
almost how many 20 years this
component like this whole

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2458-2
00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:03.444
windows is in place. But these
tests we have never seen the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2458-3
00:16:03.444 --> 00:16:03.998
failure.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-0
00:16:05.118 --> 00:16:09.711
So it I think it was for the
first time that this was there.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-1
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:14.529
So it so it the responsibility
naturally came to us to try edge

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-2
00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:19.272
it and like look for it. So the
way we approached it is so 223

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-3
00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:23.939
things here I want to say. So
first is we got aware about the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-4
00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:28.531
whole test framework like how
it, I mean how these tests are

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2529-5
00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:29.058
run so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2555-0
00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:34.122
1st is like we should be aware
about the vendor team which who

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2555-1
00:16:34.122 --> 00:16:38.258
is responsible for carrying out
and firing those test jobs.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2562-0
00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:40.208
Ashwini just sharing anything I
mean.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2579-0
00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.384
No, no, not now. I haven't
shared in some time. So right

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2579-1
00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:46.388
now I'm just telling some
background information.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2597-0
00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:52.830
So the first thing that we
should be aware about is the WTT

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2582-0
00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:48.488
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2597-1
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.598
studio. So when this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2634-0
00:16:54.678 --> 00:17:00.044
Uh, we got like the information
around this failure. The first

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2634-1
00:17:00.044 --> 00:17:05.496
thing was they they just gave us
a job failure link. So now the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2634-2
00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:10.521
way this works is this vendor
team that corresponds to our

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2634-3
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:11.628
base team of.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2641-0
00:17:12.668 --> 00:17:15.538
WSD, they, uh, they have these.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2678-0
00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:21.612
Uh, machines like like for us in
India time Wipro is the is one

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2678-1
00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:26.837
of the vendors and basically
they will they have this studio,

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2678-2
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:31.725
this software called the WTT
Studio. It is meant for this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2678-3
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:34.758
Windows testing tool. It is
called.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2735-0
00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:40.044
So from that they uh that is
linked to a background of like a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2735-1
00:17:40.044 --> 00:17:44.490
lot of machines comprising of
physical machines and VM's. All

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2735-2
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.936
of this infrastructure is there
in the background and that is

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2735-3
00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:53.382
linked to this, this, WT and
there is also one more term that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2735-4
00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:56.608
we should be aware of that is
the nebula VM.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2754-0
00:17:57.468 --> 00:18:03.868
So these two are used by these
vendor teams to test and monitor

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2754-1
00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:06.168
this monthly test pass.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2770-0
00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:11.778
Sorry. Uh, sorry to disturb you,
but is this nebula VM?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2759-0
00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:07.758
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2764-0
00:18:08.808 --> 00:18:09.158
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2795-0
00:18:13.098 --> 00:18:17.762
So this so when I said that we
have a set of physical machines

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2795-1
00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:21.018
and the VM right on which we run
the tests.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2789-0
00:18:19.168 --> 00:18:19.598
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2820-0
00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:25.282
So, uh, nebulas software is, uh,
nebulous. The name of that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2820-1
00:18:25.282 --> 00:18:29.158
software through which we gain
that access to those testing VM.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2822-0
00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:31.568
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2845-0
00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:36.238
Uh, yeah. So whenever we have
this DTP or MTP failure, the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2845-1
00:18:36.238 --> 00:18:40.298
first thing that we would want
to see is the repro of that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2845-2
00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:40.848
failure.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2869-0
00:18:41.718 --> 00:18:46.150
Now, uh, getting that repro on a
local VM is almost next to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2869-1
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.655
impossible like I think I spent
two days just to get a local

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2869-2
00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:51.098
repro.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2877-0
00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:54.608
And it is very complicated. So
the.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-0
00:18:55.418 --> 00:19:00.391
The reason is that they like
there is a test binary that is

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-1
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:05.529
just needed to be run simply but
before for that test to run.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-2
00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:09.756
There are a lot of
configurations and very complex

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-3
00:19:09.756 --> 00:19:14.646
configurations that go in the
back end, so we don't have a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-4
00:19:14.646 --> 00:19:19.867
place to like, reproduce those
configurations on our local VMS

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-5
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:25.254
and carry out the test. So that
is the first level of complexity

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2945-6
00:19:25.254 --> 00:19:25.668
that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2954-0
00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.738
Is there in this whole DTP MTP
part?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/2959-0
00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:31.158
Uh. Which is why like.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3012-0
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:36.367
Which is, which is what makes it
difficult. So which is why we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3012-1
00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:40.578
always generally need a vendor
team or to fire these jobs, or

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3012-2
00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:44.993
to set these configs. But it is
possible to do that from the WTC

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3012-3
00:19:44.993 --> 00:19:49.272
studio app that is there. So I
think one thing to to note from

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3012-4
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.698
this sync up is that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3016-0
00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:52.348
Uh, we should.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3061-0
00:19:53.668 --> 00:19:59.454
Try to have this uh WTT setup on
our dev machines and we need to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3061-1
00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:04.795
learn how to fire these test
jobs, just like we learned for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3061-2
00:20:04.795 --> 00:20:09.958
DTP. So this for MTP. Also we we
should learn to do that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3080-0
00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:15.834
The second thing to look at is
the WTL lock file. Now let me

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3080-1
00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:18.718
just see if I still have it
locally.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3082-0
00:20:20.318 --> 00:20:20.948
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3111-0
00:20:52.128 --> 00:20:56.885
Ashwini so so this, uh MTP. It
starts automatically? Or do we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3093-0
00:20:53.198 --> 00:20:53.568
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3111-1
00:20:56.885 --> 00:21:01.258
have to like submit some
requests like we do for DTP or?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3124-0
00:21:01.538 --> 00:21:06.562
Yeah, we have to submit that
request for for from that WTT

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3124-1
00:21:06.562 --> 00:21:07.498
studio app.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3127-0
00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:10.058
WSD OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3133-0
00:21:10.628 --> 00:21:12.168
Yeah. So let me just.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3135-0
00:21:12.908 --> 00:21:13.748
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3141-0
00:21:17.608 --> 00:21:19.098
Let me share my screen.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3174-0
00:21:25.378 --> 00:21:30.047
Yeah, so this WT or is also
known as Atlas Studio, so I will

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3174-1
00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:34.562
paste the wiki link in the end
so the this is how you from

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3162-0
00:21:33.128 --> 00:21:33.528
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3174-2
00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:38.388
here. I mean you launch that
application locally.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3176-0
00:21:39.128 --> 00:21:40.038
And.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3200-0
00:21:40.898 --> 00:21:45.858
There will be so generally two
to get started with. They will

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3200-1
00:21:45.858 --> 00:21:50.578
give you a a WTTW TTL file. So
WTL stands for I think this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3200-2
00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.418
thing Windows test log.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3217-0
00:21:54.918 --> 00:22:01.088
So let me see if I have that
file stored anywhere locally.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3205-0
00:21:55.308 --> 00:21:55.738
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3219-0
00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:04.118
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3225-0
00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:07.378
Better to search in this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3282-0
00:22:54.598 --> 00:22:58.969
Yeah. So that there is this
file, but I don't think it is

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3282-1
00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:03.717
that file which was there in the
failure logs of this MTP test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3282-2
00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:08.615
failure that we were working on.
But anyway to just to like give

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3282-3
00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:10.348
you a brief intro this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3319-0
00:23:11.968 --> 00:23:15.981
That is this WT file that WTL
file that we need to look at and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3319-1
00:23:15.981 --> 00:23:20.121
inside that there will be these
windows logs in which we will be

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3319-2
00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:23.178
able to see the error logs of
the failing test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-0
00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:29.740
And so that is one part we need
to understand. Then how did we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-1
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.225
try edge it? So that is the
third part now. So we we knew

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-2
00:23:34.225 --> 00:23:38.942
that this MTP test failure is
for the 8B release. So we went

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-3
00:23:38.942 --> 00:23:43.582
and checked like there were a
total of 64 bugs that were 64

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-4
00:23:43.582 --> 00:23:47.990
bugs for which the changes were
being released in the 8B

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3386-5
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.608
payload.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3416-0
00:23:49.308 --> 00:23:54.199
So from the error logs, first of
all we learned that this RPC

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3416-1
00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:59.247
test suite is failing for some
security descriptor mismatch. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3416-2
00:23:59.247 --> 00:24:03.348
that is first clue that we got
from the error logs.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3419-0
00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:04.788
2nd.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3426-0
00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:07.268
Sorry, security descriptor
mismatch means.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3422-0
00:24:05.918 --> 00:24:06.178
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3437-0
00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:12.158
Yeah, so, uh. So actually
security descriptor is 1.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-0
00:24:12.248 --> 00:24:16.843
Ohh you can say it is a security
element that we attach to the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-1
00:24:16.843 --> 00:24:21.147
most of the data structures that
go into the making of the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-2
00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:25.815
operating system in general. So
this is the term that we use to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-3
00:24:25.815 --> 00:24:30.045
like set permissions or like
like access controlled for a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-4
00:24:30.045 --> 00:24:34.348
particular data structure to
define if it is a kernel more

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-5
00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:38.943
data structure, user mode and
who and which process can go and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3500-6
00:24:38.943 --> 00:24:39.818
access that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3503-0
00:24:40.738 --> 00:24:41.288
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3505-0
00:24:40.808 --> 00:24:41.778
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3542-0
00:24:42.018 --> 00:24:46.150
Yeah. So that is like uh, so
this security descriptor was

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3542-1
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.998
something that was being
accessed by a component. And

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3542-2
00:24:49.998 --> 00:24:54.344
there that test was failing
because of some improper you can

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3542-3
00:24:54.344 --> 00:24:56.908
say access parameters or
something.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-0
00:24:57.628 --> 00:25:02.362
So it the first clue was to look
at all the security related

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-1
00:25:02.362 --> 00:25:07.174
files or the DLL's that were
being changed in the 8B payload.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-2
00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:12.063
So that was the first step. Then
second option was to look for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-3
00:25:12.063 --> 00:25:16.564
networking binaries. Any any
binaries that are related to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-4
00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:20.832
networking? Because in
networking also we use a lot of

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-5
00:25:20.832 --> 00:25:25.256
these access control parameters
to like go expose secure

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3605-6
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.118
networks. So that's why.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3642-0
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:32.268
And RPC also runs over the
network, so that was the second

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3642-1
00:25:32.268 --> 00:25:36.753
clue. So luckily in the first
set of binaries that is anything

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3642-2
00:25:36.753 --> 00:25:40.953
related to security, that is
something, I mean that is any

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3642-3
00:25:40.953 --> 00:25:44.868
binary that the ENS, the
enterprise and security team.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-0
00:25:45.528 --> 00:25:50.262
Uh ships, so we, so I and Ravi,
we were closely working with the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-1
00:25:50.262 --> 00:25:54.123
vendor team on that. We
identified a set of binaries

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-2
00:25:54.123 --> 00:25:58.857
that we should first look at. So
how did we exactly do it? So we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-3
00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:03.445
took the 8B payload that was the
machine that we were given by

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-4
00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:08.107
the vendor team and it was known
to us that in the seven C with

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3707-5
00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:11.238
the seven C payload, this test
is passing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3767-0
00:26:11.858 --> 00:26:16.373
So the way to check it was we
keep swapping the binary like

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3767-1
00:26:16.373 --> 00:26:21.189
for example let's say if if it's
the RPC for example RPC binary

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3767-2
00:26:21.189 --> 00:26:25.779
that is failing. So for RPC the
binary name is RP CRT folder

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3767-3
00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:30.595
DLL. So we take the location of
that DLL in the current machine

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3767-4
00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:33.228
and swap it with these seven
CDLL.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3801-0
00:26:34.078 --> 00:26:38.407
So right now we have the 8B DLL,
but we swap it from the seven C

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3801-1
00:26:38.407 --> 00:26:42.669
payload that we take from track
it and we swap it with that and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3801-2
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:46.598
then run the test and check if
that is the failing binary.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3803-0
00:26:47.248 --> 00:26:47.818
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3811-0
00:26:48.508 --> 00:26:50.408
Uh, regret. Did it make sense?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3813-0
00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:51.578
Yeah, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3863-0
00:26:52.088 --> 00:26:57.904
Yeah. So by doing this. Yeah. So
this is the way we triaged it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3820-0
00:26:52.838 --> 00:26:53.628
Definitely.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3863-1
00:26:57.904 --> 00:27:03.720
And luckily I think in the first
three swaps, we could identify

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3863-2
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.718
that it was a binary from the NS
team, only msvc1underscore0.dll.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3901-0
00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:16.712
So that is how we the past the
baton to the Redmond team from

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3901-1
00:27:16.712 --> 00:27:22.576
from where the DLL was getting
changed and then that team had

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3901-2
00:27:22.576 --> 00:27:28.251
to go and fix their own change
and that's how the issue got

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3901-3
00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:28.818
fixed.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3906-0
00:27:30.528 --> 00:27:31.818
Nice, good.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3935-0
00:27:31.188 --> 00:27:35.204
Yeah, yeah. Actually, one tool
that you mentioned that I guess

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3935-1
00:27:35.204 --> 00:27:38.900
it was like to know the call
graph for all the components

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3935-2
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.980
that are being called from the
current component, right? So the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3935-3
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.298
test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3961-0
00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:47.537
You remember that tool which
gave us all the EXE that were

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3940-0
00:27:44.318 --> 00:27:44.808
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3961-1
00:27:47.537 --> 00:27:49.868
required, like called by our
component.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3977-0
00:27:49.038 --> 00:27:54.168
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
So, yeah. So that tool is.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3972-0
00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:52.078
You can mention that also, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3984-0
00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:57.418
Let me check that tool.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3993-0
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:03.768
So I forgot the name of that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/3998-0
00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:06.888
Yeah, I also forgot the name.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4000-0
00:28:07.608 --> 00:28:08.238
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4005-0
00:28:10.608 --> 00:28:11.598
Thank you.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4010-0
00:28:10.808 --> 00:28:13.278
Is it dependency Walker?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4009-0
00:28:12.418 --> 00:28:13.038
You.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4017-0
00:28:14.738 --> 00:28:18.408
Ohh no no, not dependency Walker
so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4024-0
00:28:20.948 --> 00:28:22.748
Me. Check. Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4043-0
00:28:46.298 --> 00:28:49.428
Yeah, I think I lost the name of
that tool, but.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4054-0
00:28:50.088 --> 00:28:53.918
Uh, I'll definitely share one
side. Remember that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4060-0
00:28:56.678 --> 00:28:57.148
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4080-0
00:28:57.208 --> 00:29:01.939
And was to just know what all
components or the binaries that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4080-1
00:29:01.939 --> 00:29:05.448
are being called from are test
package right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4082-0
00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:06.828
Ashwini.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4084-0
00:29:07.488 --> 00:29:08.318
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4097-0
00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:11.248
Was it how long or depend?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4109-0
00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:15.375
No, I I'm not sure if that was
the thing that this I think it

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4109-1
00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:15.958
was a.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4122-0
00:29:18.238 --> 00:29:21.754
Huh. So yeah, I remember the
name of the two letters. The

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4122-1
00:29:21.754 --> 00:29:23.148
regression Finder tool.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4125-0
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:24.698
Yeah, right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4157-0
00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:29.173
Yeah. And for that tool exactly
does is. Yeah, I think Ravi, you

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4157-1
00:29:29.173 --> 00:29:33.500
are right, it takes the payload,
the current payload and gives

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4157-2
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.209
the list of all the binaries
that have gone into that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4157-3
00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:38.788
payload, I think, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4165-0
00:29:39.688 --> 00:29:41.818
Ashwini, can you please tell me
also about this tool?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4232-0
00:29:43.718 --> 00:29:48.110
Uh, I don't know much about this
tool because I also like I I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4232-1
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.360
didn't directly use it, use it.
So someone from the Redmond

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4232-2
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.611
team, his name is junrey. He
used this tool to get the list

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4232-3
00:29:56.611 --> 00:30:01.286
of the binaries. I think it is a
PowerShell script only that tool

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4232-4
00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:04.898
regression finders dot PS1 or
something like that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4235-0
00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:06.118
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4265-0
00:30:05.878 --> 00:30:10.175
So he just ran that there are
many settings in that and it's

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4265-1
00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:14.682
some it's something complicated.
So I already had the list so I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4265-2
00:30:14.682 --> 00:30:17.288
didn't need to like go and run
that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4290-0
00:30:18.038 --> 00:30:23.460
So yeah, I think we'll have this
information in some OneNote if I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4271-0
00:30:18.968 --> 00:30:19.618
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4290-1
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.828
find that OneNote, I will share
it here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4350-0
00:30:29.148 --> 00:30:32.654
Yeah, other way we can do is one
thing is that it can give you a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4296-0
00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:29.988
Around.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4350-1
00:30:32.654 --> 00:30:35.944
you give the payload like the
basically the release week and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4350-2
00:30:35.944 --> 00:30:39.180
it will give all the changes
that have happened, right. One

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4350-3
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.631
way is that other way could be
you can directly go on the track

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4350-4
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:45.058
it and you can just open the
payload, right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4365-0
00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:48.838
And you can check there all the
bugs that we are fixing in the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4365-1
00:30:48.838 --> 00:30:50.748
current build. All the current
release.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4370-0
00:30:51.188 --> 00:30:52.068
Yeah, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4393-0
00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:55.018
So that is a bit like a time
taking one. You have to click

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4393-1
00:30:55.018 --> 00:30:58.679
one by one. All the bugs, bugs
and check which binary it is

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4393-2
00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:00.448
referring to or it is fixing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4407-0
00:31:01.388 --> 00:31:04.678
So that is I guess, automated
via regression Finder tool.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4399-0
00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:02.198
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4412-0
00:31:06.318 --> 00:31:07.198
Yeah. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4411-0
00:31:06.388 --> 00:31:06.698
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4425-0
00:31:07.588 --> 00:31:10.185
So in case you get stuck with
the regression funder, you can

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4425-1
00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:11.078
do this for you also.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4450-0
00:31:12.128 --> 00:31:17.457
OK. OK. Yeah. So if like you are
any of you are free to give me a

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4450-1
00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:22.382
tutorial in this, I'll because
it looks like a good tool now

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4450-2
00:31:22.382 --> 00:31:23.108
and this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4476-0
00:31:23.928 --> 00:31:28.165
Yeah, yeah, rig with, but we
don't use it on a very daily

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4470-0
00:31:24.118 --> 00:31:28.218
I guess we yeah, right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4476-1
00:31:28.165 --> 00:31:29.698
basis. So that's why.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4477-0
00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:29.918
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4484-0
00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:31.948
Whatever we use.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4503-0
00:31:31.228 --> 00:31:34.978
Is we we have not even used it.
Actually right have we?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4491-0
00:31:32.688 --> 00:31:33.088
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4514-0
00:31:34.598 --> 00:31:36.528
Got it correct. We didn't know
we didn't.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4553-0
00:31:35.658 --> 00:31:38.674
We have not used it. We just
came to know about this tool.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4553-1
00:31:38.674 --> 00:31:41.842
Why? So just wanted to mention

00:31:41.842 --> 00:31:44.908
references. Anybody in case
requires it so they should have

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4553-3

00:32:00.888 --> 00:32:02.018
Yeah, no problem.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4622-0
00:32:03.658 --> 00:32:08.043
So you you mentioned that we
should like in the like first

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4622-1
00:32:08.043 --> 00:32:12.799
kind of step or take away that
we should have like that our own

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4622-2
00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:16.068
machines for testing now that
VMS and also.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4645-0
00:32:16.648 --> 00:32:21.635
Uh, so we should actually. No,
we can't have our own VM and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4645-1
00:32:21.635 --> 00:32:25.458
test suites. Why? Because like I
said, right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4680-0
00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:30.585
The for the configurations to
run those tests to. Getting that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4680-1
00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:35.469
locally will itself be very time
time consuming. So what we can

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4680-2
00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:38.978
instead do is learn to use that
Atlas studio.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4725-0
00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:45.034
Or we can learn to uh, fire a
test job from there, like how to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4725-1
00:32:45.034 --> 00:32:50.325
select a select the build like
for RS5 if we want to fire. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4725-2
00:32:50.325 --> 00:32:55.786
whatever setting is to be done
through that UI that much we can

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4725-3
00:32:55.786 --> 00:32:59.028
learn and keep handy it just in
case.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4730-0
00:32:59.818 --> 00:33:01.188
We want to like locally.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4738-0
00:33:01.268 --> 00:33:04.548
So I mean try these kinds of
issues.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4749-0
00:33:05.128 --> 00:33:09.868
OK, OK. So this Atlas two is our
own internal Microsoft.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4751-0
00:33:10.598 --> 00:33:11.048
Yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4753-0
00:33:11.988 --> 00:33:12.488
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4776-0
00:33:15.468 --> 00:33:19.747
So just for awareness like we,
we should be aware what all

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4776-1
00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:22.358
tools we need to keep handy,
right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4780-0
00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:24.068
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4782-0
00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:26.928
Right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4786-0
00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:28.168
Yeah, right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4789-0
00:33:30.098 --> 00:33:30.598
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4800-0
00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:33.478
OK, so nothing more from my side
then.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4796-0
00:33:32.078 --> 00:33:32.308
Well.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4850-0
00:33:34.478 --> 00:33:38.303
OK. Thanks a lot Ashwini. And I
guess we are pretty much like

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4811-0
00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.038
Yeah. Thank you.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4850-1
00:33:38.303 --> 00:33:41.942
only 5 or 10 minutes are left.
So in case Reg you have any

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4850-2
00:33:41.942 --> 00:33:45.334
doubt or Ashwini you have
anything to share other than

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4829-0
00:33:42.268 --> 00:33:42.578
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4850-3
00:33:45.334 --> 00:33:48.048
that we can stay otherwise we
can drop off.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4868-0
00:33:50.578 --> 00:33:56.487
Actually I'm a I'm ashwini and
all on a call for that unit

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4868-1
00:33:56.487 --> 00:33:57.588
testing so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4885-0
00:33:58.868 --> 00:34:01.931
Oh yeah, that unit testing
thing, right? We can discuss

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4879-0
00:34:01.438 --> 00:34:01.768
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4885-1
00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:03.408
that if you want here only.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4892-0
00:34:03.028 --> 00:34:04.788
Yeah. Yeah, we can. We can
discuss it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4890-0
00:34:04.288 --> 00:34:04.668
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4893-0
00:34:04.548 --> 00:34:05.108
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4902-0
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:09.768
OK, So what is the exact
question Revit?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4909-0
00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:12.658
OK, OK. One one second.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4920-0
00:34:20.038 --> 00:34:25.217
So actually this this unit test
was created by that feature

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4920-1
00:34:25.217 --> 00:34:25.648
team.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4948-0
00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:31.984
For that MSRC 73570. So I want
to run this unit test like for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4930-0
00:34:29.838 --> 00:34:30.188
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4948-1
00:34:31.984 --> 00:34:36.918
all the platforms. So I want to
ask you like how to do that?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4952-0
00:34:37.928 --> 00:34:38.978
OK. OK. OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4968-0
00:34:39.648 --> 00:34:45.557
So OK, I have not done this
before, but I think the way to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4968-1
00:34:45.557 --> 00:34:46.658
do this is.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5005-0
00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:53.294
But once you have this change in
your local tree, you are get the

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/4980-0
00:34:51.428 --> 00:34:51.888
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5005-1
00:34:53.294 --> 00:34:58.616
build, so there will be an EXE
test EXE or something like that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5005-2
00:34:58.616 --> 00:35:03.008
that is supposed to take a
shape. So if I see this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5018-0
00:35:03.088 --> 00:35:08.026
So like OK, your main changes in
the visualization were sorry

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5018-1
00:35:08.026 --> 00:35:09.858
virtualization dot CPP.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5020-0
00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:10.738
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5033-0
00:35:10.668 --> 00:35:15.485
Uh, so that is your main change
and the unit, where is the test?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5033-1
00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:16.818
It is in the test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5039-0
00:35:17.838 --> 00:35:19.848
Best function Taf folder?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5052-0
00:35:20.278 --> 00:35:23.999
OK, so this virtualization dot
CPP is also kind of a test file

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5052-1
00:35:23.999 --> 00:35:24.648
right then.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5075-0
00:35:24.948 --> 00:35:29.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, it
contains all the tests. Like all

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5075-1
00:35:29.268 --> 00:35:32.238
the registry tests here verify
or equal 32.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5076-0
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.428
OK, got it. Got it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5087-0
00:35:33.178 --> 00:35:35.078
Got it. So OK, so let.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5093-0
00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:37.418
So they are just added a one
test for that our MSRC.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5115-0
00:35:39.918 --> 00:35:45.048
OK, so I can try to answer this
question. Can you just paste

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5115-1
00:35:45.048 --> 00:35:49.588
this link of this virtualization
dot CPP in the chat?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5117-0
00:35:50.858 --> 00:35:51.318
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5119-0
00:35:59.928 --> 00:36:00.208
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5130-0
00:36:03.348 --> 00:36:05.918
OK, thank you. Pasted the pull
request.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5144-0
00:36:06.678 --> 00:36:10.945
Link no, no problem. I'll take.
I'll take the link from there,

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5138-0
00:36:08.698 --> 00:36:09.088
You.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5144-1
00:36:10.945 --> 00:36:11.148
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5145-0
00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:11.368
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5153-0
00:36:18.058 --> 00:36:20.908
So we usually don't do this unit
test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5156-0
00:36:23.578 --> 00:36:24.128
For.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5163-0
00:36:25.078 --> 00:36:27.008
Like a for other MSRC like.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5165-0
00:36:30.938 --> 00:36:31.628
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5220-0
00:36:31.998 --> 00:36:36.015
To rig like we have been seeing
like Updation in unit tests only

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5220-1
00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:39.723
for the these registry MSRC
right? Ashwini for the past two

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5220-2
00:36:39.723 --> 00:36:43.739
MSRC only we have seen that they
have changed the test cases for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5189-0
00:36:41.708 --> 00:36:42.118
Yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5220-3
00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:47.262
LPC and I guess for similar is
for RPC we do not see any

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5202-0
00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:44.868
But it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5220-4
00:36:47.262 --> 00:36:48.868
changes in the test cases.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5222-0
00:36:49.338 --> 00:36:49.868
Right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5226-0
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:51.158
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5257-0
00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:54.353
So basically why they are doing
is this is in the history is

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5257-1
00:36:54.353 --> 00:36:58.097
because they might have missed
this test case. So for future

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5257-2
00:36:58.097 --> 00:37:01.718
references I guess they add a
test for this scenario also.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5267-0
00:37:03.148 --> 00:37:05.008
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5300-0
00:37:03.168 --> 00:37:06.458
But I guess the same is not
applicable for a LPC and RPC. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5300-1
00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:09.802
because they are mostly the I
guess for at least for LPC they

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5300-2
00:37:09.802 --> 00:37:13.039
are race conditions. So you
cannot like add a test case for

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5300-3
00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:13.308
that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5309-0
00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:17.758
We have to manually anyway have
to, like maneuver it.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5313-0
00:37:19.958 --> 00:37:20.968
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5315-0
00:37:21.028 --> 00:37:22.038
Yeah. So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5328-0
00:37:21.688 --> 00:37:25.748
OK, so that's why I also note
that uh, that DTP tests are

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5328-1
00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:26.728
there now for.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5346-0
00:37:28.338 --> 00:37:31.509
Yeah. So for these components,
they are already standard test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5346-1
00:37:31.509 --> 00:37:34.628
cases that are already written.
So we run that in TMP, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5349-0
00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:36.568
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5369-0
00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:48.942
Yeah. So for that
virtualization, CPP, what I'm

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5369-1
00:37:48.942 --> 00:37:51.498
exactly trying to do is.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5374-0
00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:54.248
I'm trying to get the uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5393-0
00:37:55.578 --> 00:38:01.273
Ohh make fine for this test
binary so that we are able to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5393-1
00:38:01.273 --> 00:38:04.218
identify the test binary that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5404-0
00:38:05.008 --> 00:38:08.478
Uh, that this gets compiled
into, so I'm sharing my screen.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5406-0
00:38:09.058 --> 00:38:09.548
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5415-0
00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:16.888
And I'm just going to try
something in research so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5418-0
00:38:17.478 --> 00:38:18.588
OK. Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5421-0
00:38:18.928 --> 00:38:19.618
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5427-0
00:38:25.238 --> 00:38:26.608
Yeah, so here this is.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5432-0
00:38:27.768 --> 00:38:29.018
In those config.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5441-0
00:38:30.348 --> 00:38:34.478
What is this Inc file? I also
see many times.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5462-0
00:38:35.058 --> 00:38:40.195
So this is, uh, the one that uh
it it is the make file kind of

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5462-1
00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:40.928
thing so.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5464-0
00:38:41.658 --> 00:38:42.218
Uh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5497-0
00:38:43.268 --> 00:38:48.889
It's the in windows make system,
so in that whatever goals I

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5497-1
00:38:48.889 --> 00:38:54.694
think that is the that is the
extension for that is sources.in

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5497-2
00:38:54.694 --> 00:38:54.878
C.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5504-0
00:38:56.748 --> 00:38:57.158
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5518-0
00:39:01.498 --> 00:39:02.088
Thank you.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5534-0
00:39:02.518 --> 00:39:07.156
Yeah, the makes makes system
that will be usually seen Linux

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5521-0
00:39:02.528 --> 00:39:02.928
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5534-1
00:39:07.156 --> 00:39:07.688
builds.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5536-0
00:39:08.878 --> 00:39:09.258
Yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5546-0
00:39:12.388 --> 00:39:15.378
OK, this is taking forever to
load. I don't know why.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5598-0
00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:35.891
So what I'm trying to do here is
that like insidesources.in C we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5598-1
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:40.933
can see which binary this whole
thing gets compiled into. So

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5598-2
00:39:40.933 --> 00:39:46.141
there is this gets mapped and
under the test folder. So let me

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5598-3
00:39:46.141 --> 00:39:50.108
just see if that test folder is
somewhere here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5609-0
00:39:51.468 --> 00:39:55.318
So here I think all the sources
are getting built OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5617-0
00:39:59.568 --> 00:40:01.828
All this is the config dot Lib.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5625-0
00:40:03.188 --> 00:40:05.978
I'll go one level down and try
to search.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5628-0
00:40:07.908 --> 00:40:08.828
Just in case.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5655-0
00:40:16.428 --> 00:40:19.532
So one thing where Ashwini I
guess what a test folder to

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5655-1
00:40:19.532 --> 00:40:22.745
build. There must be some
special flag right? So some test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5655-2
00:40:22.745 --> 00:40:24.378
might be check might be there.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5666-0
00:40:25.518 --> 00:40:27.948
By default it might not be
building right test 1.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5661-0
00:40:25.658 --> 00:40:26.258
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5689-0
00:40:29.508 --> 00:40:33.996
I think it will get built by
default also because the there

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5689-1
00:40:33.996 --> 00:40:38.258
is in the in the PR that Rigved
shared, I don't see any.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5706-0
00:40:38.378 --> 00:40:43.601
Ohh flag or anything getting set
like for the test for the test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5706-1
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:44.988
to compile right.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5722-0
00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:48.723
Yeah, but like they might be
controlling the compile time

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5722-1
00:40:48.723 --> 00:40:50.748
only, no from the compile time
only.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5729-0
00:40:51.818 --> 00:40:53.328
That is something, yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5737-0
00:40:51.878 --> 00:40:56.108
So like we used to, yeah, we can
check like I'm also so scheme.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5749-0
00:40:55.408 --> 00:40:59.999
Ashwini actually virtualization.
There is a velocity tag like W

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5749-1
00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:01.648
if WSD feature present.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5756-0
00:41:02.688 --> 00:41:05.278
That is fine, so velocity tag.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5769-0
00:41:05.378 --> 00:41:10.698
Well, I mean that is fine like
that is not related to the test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5776-0
00:41:12.008 --> 00:41:14.258
Anyway, like this is just.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5801-0
00:41:15.028 --> 00:41:18.822
So this test will go there, but
if you are locally you will

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5801-1
00:41:18.822 --> 00:41:22.678
include this into your local
branch. Let's say for. See you.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5829-0
00:41:23.378 --> 00:41:27.330
So anyway, we are just what we
are discussing is that whether

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5805-0
00:41:23.438 --> 00:41:23.748
Mm-hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5829-1
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.708
or not that test will get
compiled when you run DCP.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5850-0
00:41:31.678 --> 00:41:35.076
So we added discussing that if
there is a special flag or

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5850-1
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:37.888
something inside some make file
or inside this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5853-0
00:41:38.588 --> 00:41:39.198
Ohh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5856-0
00:41:39.868 --> 00:41:40.788
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5858-0
00:41:41.238 --> 00:41:41.848
Like that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5891-0
00:41:43.378 --> 00:41:47.230
So basically rig to just explain
it up like a more. So once we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5891-1
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.837
give a build command. So how
does that build command knows

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5891-2
00:41:50.837 --> 00:41:54.567
what to build right? So there
must be some some like you can

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5891-3
00:41:54.567 --> 00:41:55.178
say rules.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5894-0
00:41:55.728 --> 00:41:56.138
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5923-0
00:41:56.168 --> 00:41:59.061
To be right, which which will
tell like build this file then

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5923-1
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:02.049
this file, then this file and
then pack it. All this into this

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5923-2
00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:03.898
single EXE right? Something like
that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5931-0
00:42:03.628 --> 00:42:04.818
Yes, yes.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5939-0
00:42:04.578 --> 00:42:07.908
So that is what we are
discussing. So maybe like we do

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5929-0
00:42:04.698 --> 00:42:05.118
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5939-1
00:42:07.908 --> 00:42:09.118
not like every time.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5970-0
00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:12.898
The but like, that's what we
were discussing in case the test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5970-1
00:42:12.898 --> 00:42:16.588
folder is also getting built by
default. Or do we provide any

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5970-2
00:42:16.588 --> 00:42:17.778
special flag for it?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5980-0
00:42:19.438 --> 00:42:20.558
That's what we were discussing.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5979-0
00:42:19.628 --> 00:42:20.358
OK. Uh-huh.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/5993-0
00:42:31.018 --> 00:42:33.888
And so I see a lot of test files
here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6012-0
00:42:36.278 --> 00:42:40.269
So see this we see here it is
not built as part of the anti

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6012-1
00:42:40.269 --> 00:42:43.128
build process and it may not be
compliant.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6015-0
00:42:44.388 --> 00:42:45.348
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6017-0
00:42:47.568 --> 00:42:48.288
So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6019-0
00:42:48.758 --> 00:42:49.108
Today.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6023-0
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:52.338
Alright, let me check.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6061-0
00:43:35.628 --> 00:43:40.593
So at least I think this much we
know that this test won't get

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6061-1
00:43:40.593 --> 00:43:42.878
built in the default setting.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6065-0
00:43:43.368 --> 00:43:44.288
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6079-0
00:43:43.578 --> 00:43:47.328
Right. Uh, right, Ravi, like you
also feel the same, right? Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6077-0
00:43:45.198 --> 00:43:46.548
Right, right. Right. I should.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6088-0
00:43:47.438 --> 00:43:49.978
Yeah. At least from the
different scenes. So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6090-0
00:43:50.468 --> 00:43:50.718
Correct.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6100-0
00:43:51.968 --> 00:43:56.228
In that case, I think what can
be done is that.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6122-0
00:43:59.198 --> 00:44:03.405
I guess we can directly ask the
feature team, right? Rick, did

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6117-0
00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:03.458
But a good A.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6122-1
00:44:03.405 --> 00:44:05.208
you try connecting to them?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6138-0
00:44:06.178 --> 00:44:10.257
No, actually I had to do this
with Karthik earlier, Karthik

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6138-1
00:44:10.257 --> 00:44:11.548
said. We will like.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6139-0
00:44:12.328 --> 00:44:12.738
Action.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6153-0
00:44:13.398 --> 00:44:15.428
So he's aware of these things,
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6151-0
00:44:13.498 --> 00:44:14.668
We will do it together but.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6190-0
00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:20.359
Yeah, but then? Uh, then, uh. So
on Thursday on the ship room

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6190-1
00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:25.087
day, I was busy with source repo
and lower platform validation.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6190-2
00:44:25.087 --> 00:44:29.593
So then I thought that maybe I
should try myself as the that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6190-3
00:44:29.593 --> 00:44:31.218
reading that OG Vicki.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6227-0
00:44:32.308 --> 00:44:36.440
So there is something mentioned
about this Taf test. Like you

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6201-0
00:44:34.068 --> 00:44:34.468
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6227-1
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.772
can build it locally and you can
like do BCP and then a DLL file

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6227-2
00:44:40.772 --> 00:44:43.438
will join it. Then you can use
VS test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6238-0
00:44:44.068 --> 00:44:47.188
To run all the test case, but I
could not like.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6241-0
00:44:48.718 --> 00:44:49.128
That.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6279-0
00:44:50.548 --> 00:44:54.945
Make it work so that I thought
maybe I can ask you like so

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6279-1
00:44:54.945 --> 00:44:59.490
actually I have a one-on-one
Karthik at 6:00 AM. CFE. Sorry.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6257-0
00:44:55.008 --> 00:44:55.638
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6279-2
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.768
Six just now 6:00 PM. So I'll
I'll ask him.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6276-0
00:45:02.068 --> 00:45:02.508
Sure.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6297-0
00:45:03.188 --> 00:45:08.308
Yeah. Yeah, sure. So yeah. So I
think here also right now and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6282-0
00:45:03.708 --> 00:45:04.068
Mm-hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6297-1
00:45:08.308 --> 00:45:10.868
see what is coming. Just. Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6323-0
00:45:11.628 --> 00:45:15.423
So in this also, I think, uh,
this is taking some time. So we

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6323-1
00:45:15.423 --> 00:45:19.278
can figure this out and get in
touch with the feature team and

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6323-2
00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:20.318
ask them because.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6332-0
00:45:21.338 --> 00:45:24.148
He from the sources here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6328-0
00:45:22.298 --> 00:45:22.958
Yeah, Mike.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6334-0
00:45:25.068 --> 00:45:25.498
Hmm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6368-0
00:45:25.938 --> 00:45:29.745
As such, I'm not able to see
anything directly like which

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6368-1
00:45:29.745 --> 00:45:34.011
binary, but we can get the name
of the test binary. I think that

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6368-2
00:45:34.011 --> 00:45:37.948
much we can get, but how exactly
this test they run on the?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6382-0
00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:43.058
Ohh, on their VM to validate
that we can ask them.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6374-0
00:45:40.368 --> 00:45:40.788
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6385-0
00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:44.588
Yeah, yeah, correct.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6387-0
00:45:47.128 --> 00:45:47.378
OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6394-0
00:45:48.608 --> 00:45:50.508
Yep, I guess that will do.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6407-0
00:45:49.938 --> 00:45:54.884
So I I found the test binary
name. Let me just quickly share

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6407-1
00:45:54.884 --> 00:45:55.208
and.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6414-0
00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.308
Then we can wrap up this call.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6416-0
00:45:58.658 --> 00:45:58.948
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6433-0
00:45:59.598 --> 00:46:04.057
Yeah. So there's this one UT
under score or registry

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6433-1
00:46:04.057 --> 00:46:05.318
functional.dll.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6436-0
00:46:07.078 --> 00:46:08.348
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6446-0
00:46:09.648 --> 00:46:12.618
OK, target destination. I think
I have a folder like this.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6449-0
00:46:14.358 --> 00:46:15.288
After build.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6461-0
00:46:16.248 --> 00:46:19.628
In the unit test name named as
unit test, right?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6457-0
00:46:17.988 --> 00:46:18.488
Yeah.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6465-0
00:46:20.288 --> 00:46:21.418
Yeah, unit test.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6490-0
00:46:23.718 --> 00:46:28.764
QTUTUT yes, UT yeah, there is a
function DLL file you UT

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6490-1
00:46:28.764 --> 00:46:30.888
registry functional.dll.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6499-0
00:46:30.358 --> 00:46:32.608
That gets built, right? So yeah,
the.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6500-0
00:46:31.888 --> 00:46:33.078
You that gets built here.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6512-0
00:46:33.678 --> 00:46:37.428
So see. Yeah. So that is there
then, but then.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6518-0
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:40.518
OK. Could you?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6538-0
00:46:39.658 --> 00:46:45.546
There will be. There will be no.
But how will you run the test?

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6538-1
00:46:45.546 --> 00:46:49.318
So DLL you can't run directly
right? So.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6532-0
00:46:46.338 --> 00:46:46.948
Actually.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6548-0
00:46:49.238 --> 00:46:52.668
I can I can run actually. Uh,
let me share my screen.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6551-0
00:46:53.238 --> 00:46:53.748
Spoken.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6563-0
00:46:55.028 --> 00:46:58.028
Yeah. So in here in this OG
wiki.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6579-0
00:47:00.018 --> 00:47:03.050
They have mentioned that I can
use this command to run

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6579-1
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.648
directly, run this DLL files.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6593-0
00:47:06.308 --> 00:47:09.958
Where is this this VS test
console. The test DLL file path.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6597-0
00:47:12.298 --> 00:47:13.258
OK, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6608-0

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6607-0
00:47:16.078 --> 00:47:17.118
Oh, OK.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6639-0
00:47:17.978 --> 00:47:21.737
I have to run a BCP so it's
already built this unit test

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6639-1
00:47:21.737 --> 00:47:25.561
folder. This UT registry
function or DLL. Maybe I can try

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6628-0
00:47:22.898 --> 00:47:23.318
Umm.

3d9b9d5f-cac4-454a-8808-c2c8efca111f/6639-2
