676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23482-0
00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.266
Right and rough to you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23498-0
00:00:03.426 --> 00:00:05.916
I would not. Do we want to put
we could put something in the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23498-1
00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.243
chat? Did someone already
dropped something? The chat to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23498-2
00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:08.406
say.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23511-0
00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:12.556
They say come to say, we're
starting live now.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23530-0
00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.976
Yep, good point, hold I'll do
that but not the meeting chat

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23530-1
00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.176
right the channel chat.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23532-0
00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:18.146
The channel chat right?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23535-0
00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:25.856
Pick.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23545-0
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.716
In about 45 people so far.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23571-0
00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.950
But I think it's actually
getting pretty close to what we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23571-1
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.954
had this morning, not too far
off and people will migrate

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23571-2
00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:52.316
around.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23594-0
00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.744
It'll it'll crank up there.
Yeah, it's like the we should

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23594-1
00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:58.546
see like yeah, should be a
little more investment.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23606-0
00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.616
Our party comes in right at the
hour, so.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23618-0
00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.226
And actually let me check real
quick in terms of.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23622-0
00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:11.986
How many of our?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23629-0
00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:15.036
Subject Matter experts are.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23633-0
00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.646
Here at this point.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23639-0
00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.176
Sides, Jimmy.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23646-0
00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:24.876
Well, teams is not helpful.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23661-0
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.796
I say see more and it says plus
27 more. Alright, thanks.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23688-0
00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:34.703
No, not exactly what it was
going forward, but I kind of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23672-0
00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:32.846
You guess who?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23688-1
00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.946
wanted to see who they were, but
that's OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23690-0
00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:39.636
All right?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23739-0
00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:44.113
Alright, so I'm not getting on
that. Uhm, welcome back to all

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23739-1
00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:47.420
the folks who are joining us so
far. Hopefully you had a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23739-2
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.901
wonderful day today enjoying
some of the live content here,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23739-3
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:54.266
which is, I think, a pretty
exciting part of the program.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-0
00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:58.933
I think probably a lot of you
had an experience. I heard I had

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-1
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:02.329
a number of people talking about
this experience of wanting to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-2
00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.510
see more than one of those
breakout sessions right, and so

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-3
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.906
you know, reminder it. Those are
all recorded. So for the ones

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-4
00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:12.249
that you didn't get to to see
later on as you find moments in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-5
00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.537
your hour of learning slots, or
you know your learning plan,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-6
00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:19.095
check out those those items that
you that you missed. I got to go

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-7
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:22.007
today to the one on the
developer productivity. Which

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-8
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.756
was it? It definitely
highlighted that things have

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23851-9
00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:25.726
changed with wave.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23913-0
00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:28.987
Since the time that will last,
you really understood what all

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23913-1
00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:32.032
it had and that that actually
that honestly like there's a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23913-2
00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:35.181
strong need to kind of keep up
with with how these tools are

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23913-3
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.330
evolving so that you can make
the best use of them, but also

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23913-4
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.136
had some really fantastic data
on.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23955-0
00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:45.231
The the impact that the users of
these tools experience and also

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23955-1
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.902
the the monetary aspect for
Microsoft up the productivity

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23955-2
00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:52.447
gains that can be gained on
those so. And that's pretty

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/23955-3
00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:53.966
pretty interesting area.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-0
00:02:56.206 --> 00:03:00.001
OK so this is Q&amp;A. We have a
keeps various people online

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-1
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:03.485
right now who can answer
questions. I've looked back at

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-2
00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:07.404
the that the list today that I
didn't see any questions coming

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-3
00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:11.324
in here to the main chat during
breakouts, which I think makes

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-4
00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:15.367
sense because I think everybody
is putting them into their their

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24019-5
00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:15.616
own.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24077-0
00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:22.169
Breakout sessions I I did save a
couple of questions from earlier

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24077-1
00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.499
today that were not necessarily
at the same point as as the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24077-2
00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:31.046
session we're covering that we
can go over so I can share some

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24077-3
00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:35.520
of those, and I think there's
also potentially an option that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24077-4
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.736
if.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24137-0
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.491
Uhm, if various breakout teams
had leftover questions that they

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24137-1
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.665
could also probably bring those
things back in here as well. So

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24137-2
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.691
facilitators who were facilitate
facilitating prior breakout

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24137-3
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.419
rooms, or if you were in a
breakout room and you had a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24137-4
00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.196
residual question, please feel
free to raise your hand.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24142-0
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.046
Uhm, OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24149-0
00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:58.386
So let's see one of the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24152-0
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.146
OK, let's see.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24199-0
00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:03.533
Going back and Yep, recent raise
hand anytime and if people see

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24199-1
00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:06.197
that I'm missing something in
chat or that I'm missing a hand,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24199-2
00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:08.776
it's probably slow and showing
up for me on teams. So please

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24199-3
00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:10.256
just probably let me know as
well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24223-0
00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:14.852
Uhm, I noticed today that there
were a couple of different

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24223-1
00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:18.394
people asking for reference and
good references to different

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24223-2
00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:18.916
kinds of.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24263-0
00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:22.476
Uhm of counters, right? Like
somebody looking for PERF

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24263-1
00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:25.765
counters specifically to, you
know, map to CPU groups and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24263-2
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.281
another person who was really
looking to understand what sort

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24263-3
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:31.266
of memory counters were
available.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24298-0
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:35.846
So that they could try to
investigate more deeply. So if

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24298-1
00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:38.909
if folks had pointers to where
those sorts of things were

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24298-2
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.866
documented and people could find
out that availability.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24304-0
00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:43.286
What was available?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24326-0
00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:48.884
In saying, I see you're on the
call is that a question that you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24326-1
00:04:48.884 --> 00:04:50.246
may be able to help with?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24340-0
00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:57.231
I'm sorry I must have missed
that question. Is this about

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24340-1
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:57.816
references?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24353-0
00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:03.566
Sorry this is about so and I can
post it and.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24373-0
00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:06.948
This will be interesting. Can I
post a link to this in the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24373-1
00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:08.926
meeting chat? Maybe that'll make
it easier.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24421-0
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.775
So this is one of them. One
person who is saying, hey, I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24421-1
00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:16.430
just kind of want a rundown of
what all perf counters are

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24421-2
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.084
available for me to to try to
investigate things and then

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24421-3
00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.686
another person and in a
different.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24459-0
00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:24.001
But the meeting chat saying I
want to know what sort of memory

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24459-1
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.318
counters are available so that I
can try to investigate things.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24459-2
00:05:27.318 --> 00:05:30.686
So is there some sort of a kind
of definitive listing somewhere?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24480-0
00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:40.392
I'm sorry is this about that
question in particular or is it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24480-1
00:05:40.392 --> 00:05:42.786
just about like performance
stuff in general?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24520-0
00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:47.407
Well, I grouped these two
questions. Let's start with this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24520-1
00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:50.641
one and then and then we can and
I can paste them the other half,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24520-2
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:51.866
which was the memory one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24529-0
00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:58.356
K Kernel mode performance
counters.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24599-0
00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:02.700
Yeah, I was trying to find some
like good internal resources for

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24599-1
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.052
them, but I was not able to come
up with that. I I, you know I.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24599-2
00:06:06.052 --> 00:06:09.455
I'm not the expert in this area
hold unfortunately. I can guide.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24599-3
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:12.545
Unlike other related things
around that, but I think these

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24599-4
00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:13.906
MSDN pages are good start.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24620-0
00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:20.504
I can ask around too if there's
any more, anything more specific

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24620-1
00:06:20.504 --> 00:06:22.996
about what the question was
asking about.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-0
00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:29.774
Sure, thank you yeah and I paste
it in here in the in the meeting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-1
00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:33.433
chat as well the the kind of
related one which was hey I see

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-2
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:36.911
lots of demos on process
Explorer sysinternals, but where

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-3
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.629
can I find the description of?
You know, those kind of memory

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-4
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.348
counters and everything so that
I can check out their meeting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24700-5
00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:46.866
and I see Jason posted another
link here.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24706-0
00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:50.356
Looks great, OK?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24761-0
00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:57.647
Yeah, I think I recall that
Niraj describing in one of the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24761-1
00:06:57.647 --> 00:07:02.743
other Q&amp;A is that WPR is a
tool that that if you have not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24761-2
00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:07.840
already at some point in your
time here, you'll you'll likely

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24761-3
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.306
use to analyze various issues.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24776-0
00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:14.586
With WPR, there's different ways
to enable.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24778-0
00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:16.356
Uh.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-0
00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:20.876
Different performance counters
and then you can see those

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-1
00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:24.726
events directly in WPR. Some of
the stuff that I provided

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-2
00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:28.974
earlier or like different ways
of getting at the same data, but

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-3
00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:32.890
these are these are either
platform or processor registers

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-4
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.540
that allow us to collect a
little bit more information

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24840-5
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.996
about what's going on in the
system.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24849-0
00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:42.366
And then these are just
different tools for.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24856-0
00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.806
You know reviewing those those
counters.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24883-0
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:54.406
By Jason's right. Like that, the
way that you'll likely use this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24883-1
00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:56.146
and and see it is through WPR.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24897-0
00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:04.736
There are also. I'm kind of
limited, somewhat limited.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24889-0
00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:01.536
Thank you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24917-0
00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:09.606
Runtime usage is like I'm
thinking of a query performance

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24917-1
00:08:09.606 --> 00:08:11.006
counter. Could you see?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-0
00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:16.058
We we use the high resolution
QPC extensively and multimedia

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-1
00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:21.388
like the clock and the deadlines
are everything and so we we did

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-2
00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:26.308
everything in relation to the
high resolution QPC's. And if

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-3
00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:30.900
you've ever seen a lip sync
problems, so that's because

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-4
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.902
audio and video clocks got out
of sync, and so that's just a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/24998-5
00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:39.346
constant issue. You do, but we
use these.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-0
00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:44.118
Taught these these performance
counters to represent time and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-1
00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:47.701
deadlines in the parts of the
system that are that are where

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-2
00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:51.343
that's critical and multimedia
is a deadlock. It's not a real

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-3
00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:54.515
time system, it's a highly
sensitive deadline kind of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-4
00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:57.980
system like you have to get
things to places on time or or

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-5
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.505
audio and video don't work
properly and we use keep you see

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-6
00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:04.970
as a cute as a critical part of
that to make sure that our

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25093-7
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.086
timing is straight.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25135-0
00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:13.008
Yeah yeah, only see Kristin who
had one of these original

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25135-1
00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:15.595
questions is, you know,
reiterating here that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25135-2
00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:18.913
specifically he's trying to
understand the the pressure on

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25135-3
00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:22.343
on particular CPU cores. So he
was looking for counters that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25135-4
00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:23.186
might actually.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25142-0
00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:26.556
Provide that sort of
information.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25180-0
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.975
So if there's folks out there
who actually he said, there's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25154-0
00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:30.696
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25180-1
00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:34.387
that there was actually response
on the on the thing, but it it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25173-0
00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:34.136
OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25180-2
00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:36.306
was not, not not. I don't think
it.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25212-0
00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:41.371
The response was no, not not
sure that that's the thing we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25212-1
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:44.426
know, or they would have a good
way to do that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25232-0
00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:47.229
Yeah, well, what I can do is
perhaps give you a name of a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25232-1
00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.916
person to follow up with. How's
that?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-0
00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:55.087
And that's Matthew Wolman. He's
been on a couple of the Q&amp;A

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-1
00:09:55.087 --> 00:09:58.612
as previously. He's at the
development lead of our kernel

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-2
00:09:58.612 --> 00:10:02.442
core team, 'cause I don't know
if performance counters is what

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-3
00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:06.089
we want to do, or if there's
certain APIs that we have that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-4
00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:09.979
are ways for us to report that
information to you. But he's the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-5
00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:13.687
person or somebody from his
team. Likely the person that can

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-6
00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:17.335
provide you with feedback. So
that's Matthew W as an alias.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25321-7
00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:18.246
Matthew Wolman.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25324-0
00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:22.486
Thank you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25349-0
00:10:24.106 --> 00:10:27.568
And Christine, if you have a a
follow up therapy albreda, type

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25349-1
00:10:27.568 --> 00:10:29.216
it in or two. Raise your hand.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25351-0
00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:32.236
OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25375-0
00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:38.611
Uh, as well rule we had so some
of these links. Let's say I'm

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25375-1
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:42.126
looking through the links here
that were provided.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25379-0
00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:44.206
Romans counters

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25385-0
00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:46.636
I'm curious.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-0
00:10:50.586 --> 00:10:53.834
Well, I'm not sure whether these
ones are going to address what

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-1
00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.930
rolls asking about, which I
think was kind of just trying to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-2
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.620
get a sense of, but the things
that show up in these

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-3
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.716
sysinternal tools where can I
actually find a definition for

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-4
00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:05.863
what their what they're actually
telling me? But that's how I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25495-0
00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:09.612
Yeah, so in in future in future
if I want to know what commits I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25465-5
00:11:05.863 --> 00:11:06.776
read the question.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25495-1
00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:13.606
mean or what working set means
like a man page or something.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25493-0
00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:12.646
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25500-0
00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:14.776
It doesn't call it yeah, yeah
well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25505-0
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:16.186
Well, hold on a second.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25507-0
00:11:18.146 --> 00:11:18.616
Go ahead.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25531-0
00:11:27.106 --> 00:11:30.080
Bro, I was hearing you really
softly and then and then I heard

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25531-1
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.676
somebody else talking but now I
don't hear you at all.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25537-0
00:11:33.116 --> 00:11:34.586
Basically my question was.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25587-0
00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:38.983
If I want to know what the
commit size means on woodworking

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25587-1
00:11:38.983 --> 00:11:42.568
sites mean in the future, where
can I find the definition of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25587-2
00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:46.094
these counters like the Linux
has man page or Hill where it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25587-3
00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:46.446
shows.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25590-0
00:11:47.316 --> 00:11:48.166
Discounters

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25596-0
00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:50.346
that's what I was told.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25612-0
00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:57.263
So more details on the the
various metrics that show up on

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25612-1
00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:58.016
those tools.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-0
00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:06.330
I I feel like so. It's been a
while since I've gone through

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-1
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.001
the windows internals class, but
I do I. I feel like the this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-2
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:13.318
that gather Windows internal
section kind of covered it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-3
00:12:13.318 --> 00:12:17.108
briefly and then probably sorry
the system internals section of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-4
00:12:17.108 --> 00:12:20.543
Windows internals kind of
covered it briefly and that you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-5
00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:24.274
might be able to somebody linked
earlier. The this is internal

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25706-6
00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:27.886
site where I think you could
probably again quite find that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25720-0
00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:31.856
Uhm, but yeah, what Jack is
saying here, right? Like in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25720-1
00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:32.386
terms of.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25722-0
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:33.696
Uh.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25752-0
00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:38.825
This the these courses are kind
of a summarization right of a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25752-1
00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:42.545
larger a deeper set of content,
so the books might actually be a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25752-2
00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:43.346
good approach.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25754-0
00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:53.096
Hey.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25758-0
00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:55.806
OK, here's one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25771-0
00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:02.516
Still not seeing hands, letting
of them wrong about that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25783-0
00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:06.084
Here's one that somebody was
posting during the security

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25783-1
00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:06.486
section.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25808-0
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.851
So paste in the link here, which
was kind of around. Hey, there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25808-1
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:15.286
used to be this old trick to
reset the local admin password.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25818-0
00:13:16.376 --> 00:13:18.786
Which is described in this in
this question.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25823-0
00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:21.136
And did we ever.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25827-0
00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:22.686
Close that hole.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25849-0
00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:28.769
Yeah, I saw that question.
Actually it's an interesting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25849-1
00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:31.838
one. It's it's potentially
possible that secure boot would

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25849-2
00:13:31.838 --> 00:13:32.306
fix that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-0
00:13:34.576 --> 00:13:37.178
But I'm not, I'm not certain
have to be changed for security

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-1
00:13:37.178 --> 00:13:39.822
people because basically what it
is you essentially replace a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-2
00:13:39.822 --> 00:13:42.466
binary on the system, so that
might actually. Yeah, it's it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-3
00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:45.067
it's. It's it's unclear if we do
that. If you have BitLocker

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-4
00:13:45.067 --> 00:13:47.797
enabled, then yes you couldn't.
It couldn't be done because you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/25930-5
00:13:47.797 --> 00:13:49.886
have checked to find a way to
decrypt the drive.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-0
00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:53.357
And if you look for example at a
crime and Microsoft is around

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-1
00:13:53.357 --> 00:13:55.607
all of our stuff, it was
BitLocker and it's a dead

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-2
00:13:55.607 --> 00:13:58.167
machines, etc. BitLocker
enabled, so certainly there it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-3
00:13:58.167 --> 00:14:00.726
not. It's not on really should
because you can't actually

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-4
00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:03.154
access the binaries to change
something, but generally

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-5
00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:05.934
physical access to machine. It's
only a matter of time without

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-6
00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:08.714
encryption that somebody's going
to figure out how to get into

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26021-7
00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:08.846
it.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26066-0
00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:12.735
Like I hope someone recently
like my brother-in-law basically

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26066-1
00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.852
had forgotten his password and I
ended up editing. Basically, I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26066-2
00:14:15.852 --> 00:14:18.920
hope it look up boot from a USB
hookup registry editor, enable

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26066-3
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.796
the admin account.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26110-0
00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:23.537
Log in without a password, reset
his password, log out again,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26110-1
00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:26.259
doesn't let him in account, and
then he got back on again. So

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26110-2
00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:29.155
there's there's. I mean, there's
physical access is bearable. You

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26110-3
00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:30.296
can actually do generally.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26119-0
00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:36.016
You sound handy to have around.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26124-0
00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:37.836
For your family.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26183-0
00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:46.616
OK, so that was the sorry and I
did not seem to record who had

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26183-1
00:14:46.616 --> 00:14:50.996
asked to that because I had
actually moved it over from the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26183-2
00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:55.303
meeting so but whoever it is
that did, ask that if you had

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26183-3
00:14:55.303 --> 00:14:59.829
follow up questions. So please
raise your hand or put more in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26183-4
00:14:59.829 --> 00:15:00.486
the chat.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26260-0
00:15:01.716 --> 00:15:04.763
I just one follow up for the
previous question. I wasn't I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26260-1
00:15:04.763 --> 00:15:08.016
wasn't at all equipped on the
thing. I'm used fast enough, but

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26260-2
00:15:08.016 --> 00:15:11.165
I spoke to the the dev manager
of course internals yesterday

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26260-3
00:15:11.165 --> 00:15:14.212
and he's gonna look into making
it easier to get read only

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26260-4
00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:17.516
access for everyone. Microsoft
currently you have to basically.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26282-0
00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.702
Oh my microphone broke again,
then not party to Chris access

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26282-1
00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:24.096
it. My microphone break again.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26287-0
00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:26.616
It cut out.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26300-0
00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:29.266
Is it still broken or is it back
on again?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26296-0
00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:27.856
But

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26304-0
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:30.266
it's back on.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26330-0
00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:33.107
OK good 'cause I lost it
completely in the call. Got a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26330-1
00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:35.826
call back on my phone it while I
was presenting. Well I mean

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26330-2
00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:36.806
after presented buddy.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26379-0
00:15:38.276 --> 00:15:40.858
So yeah, so basically he's
looking into seeing if it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26379-1
00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:43.768
possible to make it easier for
people to get read only access

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26379-2
00:15:43.768 --> 00:15:46.772
to this internal source code as
well, which obviously will help

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26379-3
00:15:46.772 --> 00:15:48.086
in picking those things out.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26385-0
00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:51.166
One day, OK?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26407-0
00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:59.307
And then this one came up in and
wasn't answered explicitly or in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26407-1
00:15:59.307 --> 00:16:00.976
an earlier session.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26477-0
00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:06.654
Let's bring this thing. I send,
uh, which is around? How does

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26477-1
00:16:06.654 --> 00:16:10.614
Hotpatching work? And I saw in
the chat right that there was a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26477-2
00:16:10.614 --> 00:16:13.820
link put in there to OSD Wiki
with a little bit of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26477-3
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.529
information, but if there's
anybody on this, call now. Who

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26477-4
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:20.986
wants to speak to this at A at A
at a high level like?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26487-0
00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:24.216
Then I think that would be
welcome as well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26520-0
00:16:24.826 --> 00:16:29.517
Yeah, I saw that question. I had
reached out to a couple of the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26520-1
00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:33.621
folks that worked on the
Hotpatch implementation, but I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26520-2
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:35.746
couldn't get them to to come.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26524-0
00:16:36.946 --> 00:16:37.626
Right now.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26527-0
00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:40.076
So.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26549-0
00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:46.353
You mean the high level? The way
I can try a high level? It's not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26549-1
00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:48.076
gonna do great justice.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26588-0
00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:53.162
The the wiki page that I think
it was Jason provided is is

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26588-1
00:16:53.162 --> 00:16:57.697
pretty good, but you know kind
of high level is that you know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26588-2
00:16:57.697 --> 00:17:00.476
we load a a parallel image in
memory.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26608-0
00:17:01.586 --> 00:17:06.129
And there's metadata that
describe all of the the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26608-1
00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:09.036
functions the two bihat patched.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26618-0
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:12.836
As well as the order that they
should get patched.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26620-0
00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:14.186
And.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26622-0
00:17:14.236 --> 00:17:14.706
Then

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26632-0
00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:20.366
the secure kernel implements the
hotpatch.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-0
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:26.105
A functionality so that it can
coordinate with Patch guard,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-1
00:17:26.105 --> 00:17:30.224
which is a which is a security
feature that we have in our

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-2
00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:34.204
systems to make sure that
there's no tampering of kernel

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-3
00:17:34.204 --> 00:17:38.323
data structures. So the the
secure kernel receives the all

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-4
00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:42.442
of the information to do the
patches, and is the component

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-5
00:17:42.442 --> 00:17:46.491
that actually performs the
patches, and one of the things

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-6
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:50.680
that it has to do, which I I
find interesting, is that when

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26716-7
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.006
you're patching up.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26743-0
00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:55.937
Function it's a effectively a
jump to the new implementation

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26743-1
00:17:55.937 --> 00:17:59.681
and then at the end of the
function it's gotta return back

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26743-2
00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:00.696
to the original.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-0
00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:04.923
And so we always do the
backwards, you know, patch first

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-1
00:18:04.923 --> 00:18:08.330
before the forward to make sure
that you there's no race

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-2
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.276
condition of executing the code.
The patch code before you finish

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-3
00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:15.862
that the back pointer. So it
goes through does all the back

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-4
00:18:15.862 --> 00:18:19.508
pointers and then it does all
the forward pointers and again

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-5
00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:23.214
for security reasons and working
with patchguard. This is all

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26833-6
00:18:23.214 --> 00:18:25.246
implemented in our secure
kernel.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26875-0
00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:31.865
And then probably another
interesting thing is like where

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26875-1
00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:36.530
do we use hotpatching? So we use
this in the Azure host operating

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26875-2
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.356
system so you know our OS we we
is the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26921-0
00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:45.668
Host operating system for, you
know, the Azure public cloud and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26921-1
00:18:45.668 --> 00:18:49.896
all of the VMS that we we host
in Azure and so we use

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26921-2
00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:54.046
hotpatching as a way to have
impact lists servicing.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26934-0
00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:58.726
To that host operating system
and we now have a.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26942-0
00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:03.306
An additional project called
Turbine which.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26956-0
00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:08.671
We're working with our servicing
team for bringing this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26956-1
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.936
functionality to Windows Server.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26986-0
00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:15.104
Those are the two use cases, but
the the primary one, which is

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26986-1
00:19:15.104 --> 00:19:18.424
what we've been leveraging the
last few years, is for the Azure

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/26986-2
00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:19.046
host itself.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27018-0
00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:29.252
Right there was a follow up
question here from Cameron. Is

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27018-1
00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:32.259
there a general rule for things
that can be hot patched versus

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27018-2
00:19:32.259 --> 00:19:33.166
things that cannot?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27052-0
00:19:35.356 --> 00:19:39.901
Uh, there is and I I didn't look
at the wiki page that Jason

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27052-1
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:44.818
shared in detail, but we do have
a wiki page that kind of has the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27052-2
00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:45.786
this summary.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27064-0
00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:50.366
I'm the one thing to highlight
though is that those?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27097-0
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:55.167
What cannot be hotpatch we try
to decrease overtime because

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27097-1
00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:59.040
this is so foundational to the
success of Azure that we need

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27097-2
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.056
this to go down.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27124-0
00:20:01.306 --> 00:20:05.156
Conceptually, Hotpatching is
really good for bug level

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27124-1
00:20:05.156 --> 00:20:08.936
changes or bug fixes. Rather
not, hopefully not bugs.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27147-0
00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:15.696
And that's mostly because those
changes are more well contained.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27147-1
00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:20.136
You're updating a few functions
rather than many functions.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27163-0
00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:26.343
But we've deployed features
through HOTPATCH as well in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27163-1
00:20:26.343 --> 00:20:26.826
Azure.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27212-0
00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:31.161
Uh, some of the things that used
to be a problem that we've now

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27212-1
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:34.640
solved is global variables, so
it used to be the case that you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27212-2
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.678
could not add a new global
variable with the hot patch

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27212-3
00:20:37.678 --> 00:20:39.776
'cause you 'cause you're
referencing.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27252-0
00:20:41.296 --> 00:20:46.413
Memory in the base image, and so
there's no space for a new

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27252-1
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:51.273
global variable. Now we've
instrumented every image with

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27252-2
00:20:51.273 --> 00:20:56.475
padding so that we can add new
global variables to that base

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27252-3
00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:56.986
image.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27266-0
00:20:59.756 --> 00:21:04.382
One of the things that we
sometimes run into is calling

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27266-1
00:21:04.382 --> 00:21:06.446
convention for functions.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27268-0
00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:07.766
Where?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27302-0
00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:13.512
Your top level API's have a
standardized calling convention,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27302-1
00:21:13.512 --> 00:21:18.243
but for internal functions that
perhaps only your module ever

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27302-2
00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.456
calls sometimes the compiler.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27365-0
00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:25.850
Well, perform optimizations
where it may notice that a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27365-1
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.926
particular parameter is never
used, and so it will just

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27365-2
00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:34.147
optimize it out. That's a
problem for hotpatching. 'cause

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27365-3
00:21:34.147 --> 00:21:38.660
what if a a later version of of
that binary needs to use that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27365-4
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.916
parameter? So we've we've been.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27369-0
00:21:41.986 --> 00:21:43.276
Work when we.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27389-0
00:21:44.706 --> 00:21:50.569
We can work around that by
trying to be creative and be

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27389-1
00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:52.976
more explicit with the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27441-0
00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:57.686
They're calling conventions of
each function, or sometimes

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27441-1
00:21:57.686 --> 00:22:01.530
having two versions of a
function, one where we force the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27441-2
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.573
calling convention of the base
image and then creating a new

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27441-3
00:22:05.573 --> 00:22:09.284
version with, you know, the new
desired behavior, so it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27441-4
00:22:09.284 --> 00:22:12.266
sometimes get a little bit more
tricky, but.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27466-0
00:22:13.626 --> 00:22:17.029
Those are the type of things
that an author of a hotpatch

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27466-1
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:20.196
tends to have to work through
when when creating one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27504-0
00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:27.150
Well, note in terms of the
eligibility Jack did paste in,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27504-1
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.215
there is a section in that link
that not matching which is that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27487-0
00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:30.256
I think.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27495-0
00:22:30.306 --> 00:22:30.956
Here Jack.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27504-2
00:22:31.215 --> 00:22:33.056
that talks about eligibility.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27555-0
00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:36.965
Uh, and then there was an
additional follow-up question

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27555-1
00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:40.070
come from Shell in in terms of.
Well when we can't hotpatch

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27555-2
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.227
something then how you know how
do we fix it right? Is there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27555-3
00:22:43.227 --> 00:22:46.436
another work around that needs
to be done for the Azure host?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27557-0
00:22:48.676 --> 00:22:49.186
Yes.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27560-0
00:22:49.976 --> 00:22:50.846
Great question.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27583-0
00:22:54.156 --> 00:22:59.523
In some cases it just means that
new feature or functionality

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27583-1
00:22:59.523 --> 00:23:01.686
needs to wait until I've.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27611-0
00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:09.220
You know a future OS where we
may take impact to go through an

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27611-1
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.186
OS update. So the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27634-0
00:23:12.116 --> 00:23:16.020
We have a technology which we
call VM Foo which stands for VM

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27634-1
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.846
preserving host update where.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-0
00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:22.886
Uhm, we pause BMS in memory and
then we do a soft reboot from

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-1
00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:27.585
the old kernel to the new kernel
while those BMSR paused. And

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-2
00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:32.436
then we resume the VMS after we
booted into the note new OS. So

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-3
00:23:32.436 --> 00:23:37.136
we're currently for you know,
contacts. We're we're doing one

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-4
00:23:37.136 --> 00:23:41.987
of these deployments right now
in Azure, where we're going from

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-5
00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:46.838
an OS version that we call Rs.
1.86 and we're updating to an OS

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27747-6
00:23:46.838 --> 00:23:49.036
that we call Azure Host 2021.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27803-0
00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:53.236
And we're using VM Foo as a way
to do that update. Now the the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27803-1
00:23:53.236 --> 00:23:57.122
challenge with this is that we
have roughly a 32nd downtime

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27803-2
00:23:57.122 --> 00:24:01.267
where those beams are paused in
memory. While that may not seem

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27803-3
00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:05.153
like a significant amount of
time, that is enough time that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27803-4
00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:05.606
people.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27819-0
00:24:07.206 --> 00:24:11.956
And notice up lip and so we we
do that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27850-0
00:24:13.296 --> 00:24:18.722
Very sparingly and you know lean
on things like hotpatch. We also

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27850-1
00:24:18.722 --> 00:24:23.820
are trying to build out other
impact list update technologies

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27850-2
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.066
so.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27862-0
00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:29.206
Our hypervisor team implemented
a feature called hypervisor.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27881-0
00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:35.482
A hot restart where we are able
to service the hypervisor

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27881-1
00:24:35.482 --> 00:24:36.056
itself.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27936-0
00:24:36.896 --> 00:24:41.313
Similarly, by like just re
loading a second hypervisor in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27936-1
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:46.035
memory, initializing it and then
transferring state to it and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27936-2
00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:48.776
that has about a one second
impact.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27938-0
00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:51.086
But

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27949-0
00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:54.816
so so yeah, to you know your
question challenge like.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27971-0
00:24:55.976 --> 00:24:59.606
We're going to have multiple
tools in our tool belt will use

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27971-1
00:24:59.606 --> 00:25:02.046
whatever one is the least
impactful and.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27984-0
00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:06.588
You know we want to minimize
that impact for her for Azure

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/27984-1
00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:07.056
customers.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28008-0
00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:15.563
Also call out in terms of the
you know, physical security

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28008-1
00:25:15.563 --> 00:25:18.896
discussion we were having
earlier that he had did post in.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28015-0
00:25:20.116 --> 00:25:21.776
Related talk.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28021-0
00:25:22.886 --> 00:25:24.416
So we're interested in that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28037-0
00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:29.197
Yeah, that's actually my
favorite strike talk I've ever

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28037-1
00:25:29.197 --> 00:25:31.606
seen, and so it's highly
recommended.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-0
00:25:33.536 --> 00:25:37.310
We don't. We don't worry about
physical access security on the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-1
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.903
PC S and servers. You know the
servers are locked in a data

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-2
00:25:40.903 --> 00:25:44.677
center, so only trusted people
have access and PCs. We've just

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-3
00:25:44.677 --> 00:25:48.271
kind of given up on that Xbox
their their business model is

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-4
00:25:48.271 --> 00:25:51.984
based on. You can't hack and
cheat the system 'cause we there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-5
00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:55.638
would be no economic value on
Xbox if it was cheap table and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-6
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:59.231
so they have to go through great
lengths to secure physical

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28155-7
00:25:59.231 --> 00:26:02.106
access. And even if you can
crack open the box.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28217-0
00:26:02.346 --> 00:26:06.569
And put oscilloscopes on things
like you still can't hack. UM,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28217-1
00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:10.858
the Xbox is fascinating. 'cause
you know, I, I work on the, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28217-2
00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:14.611
know, the client OS and so I
never worry about physical

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28217-3
00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:18.431
access security. They worry
about it constantly, so it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28217-4
00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:21.916
just interesting to see a
different tack on things.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28229-0
00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:32.196
Up in a little bit more on the
chat here about.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28264-0
00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:37.136
Various mitigating factors for
when we, when we can't do the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28264-1
00:26:37.136 --> 00:26:40.588
hotpatching. That's it for the
set of questions that I had

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28264-2
00:26:40.588 --> 00:26:43.806
noted hadn't been answered over
the course of the day.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28283-0
00:26:45.076 --> 00:26:48.158
Anyone else have questions
they'd like to raise their hand

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28283-1
00:26:48.158 --> 00:26:49.046
or put into chat?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28298-0
00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:53.696
Uh, for themselves or that they
saw in their breakout rooms.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28314-0
00:27:27.456 --> 00:27:29.766
I think everybody just be it
just be tired.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28333-0
00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:38.046
It's Friday, it's 319. The sun
is kinda out, honestly.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28367-0
00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:42.557
Yeah, I tell another war story,
but nobody wants to hear another

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28338-0
00:27:39.996 --> 00:27:40.426
You know?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28367-1
00:27:42.557 --> 00:27:45.301
war story for me. They want to
go home. Or you know, virtually

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28367-2
00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:45.736
call home.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28393-0
00:27:47.126 --> 00:27:50.095
Looks like it looks like two
came in here. Cameron asked, are

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28393-1
00:27:50.095 --> 00:27:52.633
there any interesting
developments for the future of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28393-2
00:27:52.633 --> 00:27:53.016
Windows?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28399-0
00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:54.396
It's the first one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28410-0
00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:57.706
Yeah, if I'll try to answer that
one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28418-0
00:27:58.856 --> 00:28:00.486
And the you know it's.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28452-0
00:28:01.486 --> 00:28:05.813
I'll answer it how I often share
when I'm doing interview loops.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28452-1
00:28:05.813 --> 00:28:10.074
So are you know I'm doing? You
know various recruitment for the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28452-2
00:28:10.074 --> 00:28:10.606
OS team.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28492-0
00:28:12.096 --> 00:28:15.844
You know OS development is one
of these interesting areas where

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28492-1
00:28:15.844 --> 00:28:19.241
when you think of computer
science, it's one of the older

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28492-2
00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:22.814
you know fields of computer
science and and so question that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28492-3
00:28:22.814 --> 00:28:23.926
I'm often asked is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28518-0
00:28:24.706 --> 00:28:28.989
No. What kind of innovation are
we doing and and so I, you know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28518-1
00:28:28.989 --> 00:28:32.936
referred to some of the the work
that we've recently done.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28550-0
00:28:33.606 --> 00:28:38.522
You know at mention VM Fu and
HRAS, these update technologies

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28550-1
00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:43.199
but a really profound one is
virtualization based security

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28550-2
00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:43.516
BBS.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28552-0
00:28:44.296 --> 00:28:44.966
Where?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28580-0
00:28:45.746 --> 00:28:50.176
We are now leveraging the
hypervisor to provide a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28580-1
00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:55.756
effectively a paradigm shift to
the way that software runs on.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28590-0
00:28:56.416 --> 00:28:58.426
You know, uh, on on the system.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28642-0
00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:03.918
You know, over the last week, or
you know, maybe even before this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28642-1
00:29:03.918 --> 00:29:08.005
last week, you you've learned
about the difference between

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28642-2
00:29:08.005 --> 00:29:12.369
user mode and and kernel mode
and the separation or the use of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28642-3
00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:16.387
a privileged level of to
separate applications from their

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28642-4
00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:17.356
kernel itself.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28678-0
00:29:17.946 --> 00:29:22.028
With VBS, we took that paradigm.
Put the hypervisor at the bottom

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28678-1
00:29:22.028 --> 00:29:25.862
of it, and now we have multiple
virtual trust levels. What we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28678-2
00:29:25.862 --> 00:29:29.016
call BTLS where we have user
mode and kernel mode.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28704-0
00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:33.724
And what this is allowed us to
do is start to pull security

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28704-1
00:29:33.724 --> 00:29:37.526
code over into that higher
privileged virtual trust level.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28706-0
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.166
And.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28710-0
00:29:40.036 --> 00:29:41.286
You know, provide.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28755-0
00:29:41.926 --> 00:29:46.841
Uh, I fundamental paradigm shift
where even kernel mode is not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28755-1
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.443
trusted or potentially not
trusted, and that that's a game

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28755-2
00:29:51.443 --> 00:29:55.812
changer and such a innovative
paradigm shift. You know,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28755-3
00:29:55.812 --> 00:30:00.414
evolving from many decades of
this established user kernel

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28755-4
00:30:00.414 --> 00:30:01.116
boundary.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28781-0
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:06.976
Yeah, I see that Pedro Marks
mentions confidential VM. This

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28781-1
00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:10.846
is another really amazing
innovation that we're going

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28781-2
00:30:10.846 --> 00:30:12.566
through right now where.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28808-0
00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:18.422
Talked about Azure earlier and
hosting a virtual machines. What

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28808-1
00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:22.516
confidential VMS say is that we
don't trust the host itself.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28818-0
00:30:23.226 --> 00:30:27.856
And so we leverage some
innovation in silicon.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28838-0
00:30:28.516 --> 00:30:32.502
As well as changes in our
software stack to now implement

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28838-1
00:30:32.502 --> 00:30:36.006
this paradigm shift where the
host is not trusted.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28848-0
00:30:38.176 --> 00:30:41.586
So lots of really great
innovations happening and and.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28896-0
00:30:42.186 --> 00:30:45.634
You know I can't forecast what
the future fully has in store,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28896-1
00:30:45.634 --> 00:30:48.970
but just this recent work that
we've done over the last few

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28896-2
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.362
years shows that there's a lot
of innovation still happening

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28896-3
00:30:52.362 --> 00:30:55.476
and pretty exciting to see where
it goes in the future.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28944-0
00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:08.897
A little bit up the stack a
little bit, so I'll describe

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28944-1
00:31:08.897 --> 00:31:14.719
some things we're doing in WTX
uhm is figuring out how to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28944-2
00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:16.826
responsibly bring in.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28959-0
00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:22.872
AI and machine learning
workloads. Uhm to help users

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/28959-1
00:31:22.872 --> 00:31:23.686
which is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-0
00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:29.086
Uhm, a complicated area because
it's pretty easy to figure out

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-1
00:31:29.086 --> 00:31:34.105
features. Oh, learn from what
the user is doing and help them

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-2
00:31:34.105 --> 00:31:38.963
do XY or Z, But there's quite
often privacy implications of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-3
00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:43.901
almost any workload that you do
there, so it's a very tricky

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-4
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:48.758
area to figure out how to do
something useful that respects

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-5
00:31:48.758 --> 00:31:53.615
the users privacy. So a lot of
when you look at shorter and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29047-6
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:54.586
longer term.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-0
00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:58.083
Planning bambos a lot of the
themes have to do with AI and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-1
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:01.753
machine learning and how we can
responsibly integrate that and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-2
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:05.306
one other detail that's just
kind of a little bit of insight

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-3
00:32:05.306 --> 00:32:08.859
baseball. If you ever typed in
Word and it starts predicting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-4
00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:12.412
the words, you're going to say
you're going to type and then

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-5
00:32:12.412 --> 00:32:15.791
allows you to autocomplete
without fully typing the word.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29138-6
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:17.596
We call that augmentation loop.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-0
00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:23.572
And uhm, that is a cloud based
interaction. And so the the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-1
00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:28.265
model. The AI model for this is
in the cloud and so office app

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-2
00:32:28.265 --> 00:32:33.107
will actually hit the cloud. Now
if you think about it, we gotta

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-3
00:32:33.107 --> 00:32:37.204
have a huge subscription
business for this. And so the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-4
00:32:37.204 --> 00:32:41.823
users kind of paid for the cost
of goods or the COGS on that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-5
00:32:41.823 --> 00:32:46.367
But we won't want to bring in
the augmentation loop into the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29232-6
00:32:46.367 --> 00:32:49.496
editor on Windows we don't have
the same.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-0
00:32:49.546 --> 00:32:52.877
Level up subscription. Paying
for those COGS and so we'd

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-1
00:32:52.877 --> 00:32:56.676
actually don't want to run that.
That model in the cloud, and so

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-2
00:32:56.676 --> 00:33:00.474
we want to run that. Bring that
down locally, but when you bring

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-3
00:33:00.474 --> 00:33:04.097
it down locally, they increase
the size of Windows, which has

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-4
00:33:04.097 --> 00:33:07.720
its own costs, so there's just a
lot of work that needs to be

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-5
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.285
done there in order to both
responsibly put this into the OS

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-6
00:33:11.285 --> 00:33:14.908
and also to do it in a way that
makes economic sense for both

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29336-7
00:33:14.908 --> 00:33:16.076
the customer and us.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29357-0
00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:20.530
So I'd say that's another big
area of investment in the in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29357-1
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.456
future windows.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29393-0
00:33:27.896 --> 00:33:31.744
So that ablade put something in
the chat. He's not on the call

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29393-1
00:33:31.744 --> 00:33:35.409
right now, but he must have
known that what we were talking

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29393-2
00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:36.386
about he shared.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29430-0
00:33:38.176 --> 00:33:41.614
Well, unwinding a little bit the
last two years we've

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29430-1
00:33:41.614 --> 00:33:45.561
participated in active exercise
that we call the TLR P so the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29430-2
00:33:45.561 --> 00:33:47.216
technical long range plan.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29432-0
00:33:47.856 --> 00:33:48.586
Where?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29435-0
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:51.796
We were.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29457-0
00:33:53.066 --> 00:33:57.641
*** bombing yeah where we're
we're trying to articulate, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29457-1
00:33:57.641 --> 00:34:01.766
know the the three to five year
plan. Hey there he is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29463-0
00:34:03.446 --> 00:34:04.826
Your ears must be hurting.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29496-0
00:34:05.896 --> 00:34:09.663
Uh, so where we try to
articulate the the plan for the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29496-1
00:34:09.663 --> 00:34:13.978
the middle range? The three to
five years out and and a lot of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29496-2
00:34:13.978 --> 00:34:14.526
that is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29534-0
00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:19.615
Looking at the the future what's
happening in the industry,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29534-1
00:34:19.615 --> 00:34:24.412
what's happening in silicon and
identifying the investments that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29534-2
00:34:24.412 --> 00:34:28.176
either we are or should be
making across the team.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29546-0
00:34:29.026 --> 00:34:31.876
And so those are the two
documents that he shared there.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29564-0
00:34:37.306 --> 00:34:39.997
Now, if you have anything to add
to that, I will add it now that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29564-1
00:34:39.997 --> 00:34:40.576
you joined us.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29570-0
00:34:41.776 --> 00:34:42.926
No shirt, no. I've been here.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29586-0
00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:47.386
Oh my teams is acting up then.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29616-0
00:34:45.756 --> 00:34:48.522
Yeah he was. He was turning on
the camera 'cause I was dissing

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29616-1
00:34:48.522 --> 00:34:51.067
him in the chat and he's like
no, no I'm I'm not. I'm not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29607-0
00:34:49.126 --> 00:34:51.036
Yeah, I was like.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29616-2
00:34:51.067 --> 00:34:52.296
bombing, I'm here so he was.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29617-0
00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:52.746
Here I'm here.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29622-0
00:34:53.566 --> 00:34:54.426
Ha ha.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29634-0
00:34:53.816 --> 00:34:57.196
Uh, sure, uh, no. I mean, I
think it's a great question.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29662-0
00:34:58.426 --> 00:35:02.301
In and I think the in the past
couple of years in particular,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29662-1
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:05.989
we've tried to put, you know, a
lot more focus on thinking

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29662-2
00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:07.676
beyond the current release.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29681-0
00:35:08.316 --> 00:35:12.289
You know and and projecting
forward to to see, you know,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29681-1
00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:12.986
given the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-0
00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:16.834
Given the pace at which
technology moves and given you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-1
00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:19.800
know the kind of long term
efforts that some of the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-2
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.336
competition you know is, is is
pursuing, you know where do we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-3
00:35:23.336 --> 00:35:26.759
think we need? It's a land you
know in like a three to five

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-4
00:35:26.759 --> 00:35:30.353
year time frame you know. And
what does that imply for what we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-5
00:35:30.353 --> 00:35:33.718
should be doing? Great now. And
so the technical langrange

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-6
00:35:33.718 --> 00:35:37.198
planner for you know, is that's
really. It's motivation, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-7
00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:40.506
know. And it's been super
helpful. You know both for like

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29796-8
00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:43.586
you know, maybe pulling their
heads up, you know and.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-0
00:35:43.986 --> 00:35:47.649
Elevating the importance of
things that maybe you were kind

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-1
00:35:47.649 --> 00:35:51.251
of in your shoving their long
you know with less with less

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-2
00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:54.975
urgency, you know as well as
highlighting that maybe some of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-3
00:35:54.975 --> 00:35:58.882
the things that we're doing that
are not as differentiated, and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-4
00:35:58.882 --> 00:36:02.729
that maybe we could do lesson to
make more of an impact on the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-5
00:36:02.729 --> 00:36:06.697
things that are more back then.
So I'm feel free to take a look.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-6
00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:10.604
I mean, I think it's intended to
be a collaborative effort, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-7
00:36:10.604 --> 00:36:14.572
know, the docs are available. We
have not perhaps done as good a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29909-8
00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:14.816
job.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-0
00:36:14.866 --> 00:36:18.765
As we could, you know, in
bringing the entire team you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-1
00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:22.805
know along you know, and
together you know. I think it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-2
00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:26.915
more of a communications
challenge than anything, but you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-3
00:36:26.915 --> 00:36:31.381
know, as you you know, dig into
into the code base and now and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-4
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:35.917
into the architecture. You know
this vehicle is there, you know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/29978-5
00:36:35.917 --> 00:36:36.696
for us too.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30010-0
00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:41.820
But I think together about where
we want to go. You know I've

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30010-1
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.743
already gotten 2 feature
requests you know out of Salah

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30010-2
00:36:45.743 --> 00:36:49.176
and Dylan, you know from our
security isolation.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30036-0
00:36:49.686 --> 00:36:55.010
A deep dive, you know breakdown,
you know and so so so make make

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30036-1
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.566
use of these tools.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30047-0
00:36:57.526 --> 00:36:59.356
I think I've figured out how to
do one of them already.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30054-0
00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:02.476
Awesome, see asking you shall
receive.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30070-0
00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:07.961
Pedro, would you be willing to
tell us about the best

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30070-1
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:09.326
innovation of the century?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30100-0
00:37:16.846 --> 00:37:19.761
It's a I'm I'm a very modest
person so I would never consider

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30100-1
00:37:19.761 --> 00:37:22.676
something that I wrote as the
best innovation of the century.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30122-0
00:37:24.306 --> 00:37:28.506
But I think it's pretty dope.
Uhm, so in the past when we're

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30122-1
00:37:28.506 --> 00:37:30.916
dealing with emulation
everything.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-0
00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:36.206
The principles are very always
very similar. You run, you have

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-1
00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:40.577
an emulator and everything
inside the emulator is a maginus

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-2
00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:45.094
architecture, so I don't know if
you are if you are running Q

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-3
00:37:45.094 --> 00:37:49.028
emulator, everything inside of
the accumulator is the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-4
00:37:49.028 --> 00:37:52.452
architecture that you're
emulating. There's no

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30195-5
00:37:52.452 --> 00:37:53.326
interchange.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30250-0
00:37:53.986 --> 00:37:58.247
You can be interchanging with
the host emulator by the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30250-1
00:37:58.247 --> 00:38:03.282
hardware in layer or if you have
a name later like while 64 your

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30250-2
00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:08.240
your interfaces at the syscall
layer, but all of your user mode

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30250-3
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.176
is the same architecture.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30252-0
00:38:11.136 --> 00:38:11.746
Uhm?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30308-0
00:38:12.646 --> 00:38:16.867
We kind of broke all the all
these ancient rules of emulation

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30308-1
00:38:16.867 --> 00:38:20.748
with ARM 64 AC, but I'll by
allowing not only to mix and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30308-2
00:38:20.748 --> 00:38:24.628
match DLLS of different
architectures loaded in the same

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30308-3
00:38:24.628 --> 00:38:28.645
process, but you can actually
statically link functions of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30308-4
00:38:28.645 --> 00:38:31.776
different architectures into the
same binary.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30315-0
00:38:32.426 --> 00:38:34.076
So I thought it was cool.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30318-0
00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:35.826
It's a.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30383-0
00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:41.032
He's like you, you come, you
take a piece of of C code and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30383-1
00:38:41.032 --> 00:38:44.944
you compile it for X64. You take
a piece of arm C of C code and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30383-2
00:38:44.944 --> 00:38:48.549
you compile it for ARM 64. You
feed both into link and you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30383-3
00:38:48.549 --> 00:38:52.216
don't get an error. You actually
get a binary that runs so.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30388-0
00:38:53.886 --> 00:38:54.666
I thought it was cool.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30391-0
00:38:57.726 --> 00:38:58.336
Thank you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30424-0
00:39:00.316 --> 00:39:03.409
OK, so before we we finish up on
this topics, this is a pretty

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30424-1
00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:06.404
broad topic. Anybody else have
anything they wanna throw out

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30424-2
00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:06.846
there as?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30427-0
00:39:07.966 --> 00:39:09.096
Exciting upcoming

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30445-0
00:39:19.686 --> 00:39:23.692
OK, maybe that was the requisite
get off mute, pause. You never,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30445-1
00:39:23.692 --> 00:39:24.616
you never know.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30448-0
00:39:25.326 --> 00:39:25.836
Uhm?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30457-0
00:39:27.526 --> 00:39:29.016
Great thank you for that link as
well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30523-0
00:39:31.756 --> 00:39:36.493
OK, so other question was, hey
light and fluffy. That's nice.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30523-1
00:39:36.493 --> 00:39:40.848
Uhm yeah, strategies for
navigating the windows codebase

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30523-2
00:39:40.848 --> 00:39:45.890
so mentioned so far right by the
Oscar was research and find, but

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30523-3
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:50.856
also in response to that people
talking here about the areas and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30523-4
00:39:50.856 --> 00:39:54.446
ownerships, portions, a video
and yeah, solid.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30563-0
00:39:56.356 --> 00:39:58.793
So the the in terms of like
navigating. I don't know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30563-1
00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:01.644
precisely what the ASK is, but
I've often found if I'm trying

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30563-2
00:40:01.644 --> 00:40:04.449
to understand something. I'm
just connected debugger and see

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30563-3
00:40:04.449 --> 00:40:05.046
what it does.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-0
00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:08.474
So in that way you would think
you could set to the code and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-1
00:40:08.474 --> 00:40:11.064
see what it's actually up to and
and take like real things that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-2
00:40:11.064 --> 00:40:13.613
we I mean. For example, I debug
through many parts of the code

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-3
00:40:13.613 --> 00:40:16.162
along before works in the kernel
team, and when I worked there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-4
00:40:16.162 --> 00:40:18.428
was like OK. I'm already
familiar with this. 'cause you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-5
00:40:18.428 --> 00:40:20.977
know, if I had there are some
way. I don't just select sort of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-6
00:40:20.977 --> 00:40:23.242
mail the kernel team, it's
except for that I remembered

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-7
00:40:23.242 --> 00:40:25.751
that plugs hey, what's going on?
Uh, beyond debug all the way

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-8
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:28.340
through the path and see what's
actually going to understand it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-9
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.687
and then figure it out from
there. So sometimes it's also

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30700-10
00:40:30.687 --> 00:40:31.496
very useful as well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30749-0
00:40:33.366 --> 00:40:37.496
Yeah, if the if the question is
just like hey where is the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30749-1
00:40:37.496 --> 00:40:41.976
source code for feature X like 1
trick that I use is to write a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30749-2
00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:46.526
program that uses feature X step
step in see what DLL you landed

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30749-3
00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:46.736
in.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30784-0
00:40:47.896 --> 00:40:50.789
Uhm, and then you can ask the
debugger for line numbers and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30784-1
00:40:50.789 --> 00:40:53.778
it'll give you a full file path
and it's like whoo now I know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30784-2
00:40:53.778 --> 00:40:54.646
where the code is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30788-0
00:40:58.256 --> 00:40:59.266
Yes, we want to.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30809-0
00:41:02.166 --> 00:41:06.247
Send yes, a strong a strong
thumbs up for have multiple tabs

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30809-1
00:41:06.247 --> 00:41:07.986
in research, that's great.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30823-0
00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:13.536
Yeah, I think solid so.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30824-0
00:41:12.476 --> 00:41:14.006
Yeah, give a big thumbs up for
that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30839-0
00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:18.126
Open dash, a trick that under
Raj posted. I love that one.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30884-0
00:41:21.036 --> 00:41:24.712
If you're if you're talking
about like searching through

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30884-1
00:41:24.712 --> 00:41:28.775
code and finding the teams that
owned the code and whatnot, if

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30884-2
00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:32.386
you actually find the code in
Ado, ADO can search code.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30914-0
00:41:32.986 --> 00:41:36.810
Not as proficiently as research,
but almost there, but definitely

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30914-1
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.227
can search for definition of
functions. And then there's a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30914-2
00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:41.096
tab for owners.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30955-0
00:41:41.886 --> 00:41:45.778
Uh, so that is that is pretty
good. Also if you search on

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30955-1
00:41:45.778 --> 00:41:50.005
research, you can open a a side
band on the right side that it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30955-2
00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:53.896
show use the all of the changes
that went into that file.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/30966-0
00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:57.446
You can learn a lot. I mean, I
find that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31003-0
00:41:58.326 --> 00:42:01.889
Looking at the code and
understanding why it's doing

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31003-1
00:42:01.889 --> 00:42:06.057
what it's doing only tells you
so far as sometimes 50% of why

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31003-2
00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:09.216
things are that way. The other
50% is history.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31048-0
00:42:10.766 --> 00:42:15.756
You learn a lot just by knowing
how things you know evolved to,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31048-1
00:42:15.756 --> 00:42:20.355
how they are, and sometimes
looking at the the changes and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31048-2
00:42:20.355 --> 00:42:25.266
how it was in Windows 7 and how
it was in Windows Server 2003.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31071-0
00:42:26.536 --> 00:42:29.563
It's it's can teach you a lot
about a component, specially if

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31071-1
00:42:29.563 --> 00:42:31.906
you're taking on any ownership
click component.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31077-0
00:42:33.816 --> 00:42:35.766
One of the pitfalls of.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31098-0
00:42:37.016 --> 00:42:39.959
Using 80 or research to like
find the definition of a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31098-1
00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:41.866
function is that often a
function.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-0
00:42:43.196 --> 00:42:46.445
You'll you'll find that like,
oh, they're like 25 copies of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-1
00:42:46.445 --> 00:42:49.964
this function. There's like the
Windows desktop version. There's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-2
00:42:49.964 --> 00:42:52.995
the Xbox version. There's a W
cast version. There's MFC

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-3
00:42:52.995 --> 00:42:56.352
version and and so you do have
to be careful sometimes you're

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-4
00:42:56.352 --> 00:42:59.763
like, oh, give me the definition
of format message and they're

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31160-5
00:42:59.763 --> 00:43:00.466
like 80 hits.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31169-0
00:43:01.356 --> 00:43:02.806
You know, like I'll never find
it now.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31182-0
00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:08.576
Also watch out for the A&amp;W
suffixes.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31219-0
00:43:18.256 --> 00:43:21.451
Put in a link as well in terms
of expanding out on the finding

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31219-1
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:24.443
feature owners for when it's
not. When you're not starting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31219-2
00:43:24.443 --> 00:43:26.776
from that, I know exactly where
this code is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31253-0
00:43:28.386 --> 00:43:31.115
And also you know if if if folks
have additional tips there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31253-1
00:43:31.115 --> 00:43:33.706
right? Please feel free to
document them this. This came

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31253-2
00:43:33.706 --> 00:43:36.616
from, you know, new hires asking
how am I supposed to identify?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31262-0
00:43:37.276 --> 00:43:39.866
Who who knows about this thing,
right so?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31276-0
00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:43.844
And try to stay away from fights
trickle. It'll probably be in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31276-1
00:43:43.844 --> 00:43:44.706
all the files locally.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-0
00:43:46.346 --> 00:43:48.744
I have done it 'cause it
basically it's setting in GPO,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31283-0
00:43:46.936 --> 00:43:47.306
Yes, Sir.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-1
00:43:48.744 --> 00:43:51.228
GVFS. Right so it's kind of
sitting in a virtual copy and

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-2
00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:53.711
until you actually start
accessing and are generally just

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-3
00:43:53.711 --> 00:43:56.238
stays over there. So I've
actually sometimes ended up with

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-4
00:43:56.238 --> 00:43:58.807
a whole bunch of files that I
didn't realize this code path

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31349-5
00:43:58.807 --> 00:43:59.406
pointing down.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31365-0
00:44:00.626 --> 00:44:01.976
But Pfeister is also useful too.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31380-0
00:44:00.626 --> 00:44:03.765
Yeah, fine fine staring through
3,000,000 files will take a long

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31359-0
00:44:01.046 --> 00:44:01.436
And.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31380-1
00:44:03.765 --> 00:44:05.406
time and burn a lot of
bandwidth.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31454-0
00:44:06.986 --> 00:44:10.546
Yeah, but if you ever
accidentally or purposefully

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31454-1
00:44:10.546 --> 00:44:15.012
hydrate based on, uh, feinster,
you actually can UN hydrate the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31454-2
00:44:15.012 --> 00:44:18.991
the repo back into virtual
thousand GPS. There's there's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31454-3
00:44:18.991 --> 00:44:23.178
information on West two wiki how
to do that. If you've ever

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31454-4
00:44:23.178 --> 00:44:27.156
gotten too many files actually
on disk in your re bumps.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31461-0
00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:30.056
You just have to notice and
remember to go.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31466-0
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:31.756
I'll do it.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31490-0
00:44:32.706 --> 00:44:37.122
Jeff, you have a a follow up
question here. AVL Petland of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31490-1
00:44:37.122 --> 00:44:37.496
SDPR.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31511-0
00:44:38.346 --> 00:44:40.584
Uh, I'm confused by your
question. Do you want to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31541-0
00:44:40.316 --> 00:44:44.118
Remember that I was just when I
was trying. I mean, it's you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31511-1
00:44:40.584 --> 00:44:41.836
elaborate? Is this not lame?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31541-1
00:44:44.118 --> 00:44:47.858
know I'm I'm only gonna know old
school references given my

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31541-2
00:44:47.858 --> 00:44:51.286
familiarity with code in recent
years, if not decades.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31594-0
00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:55.673
Uh, STPR was for any given file
it listed the file out and then

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31594-1
00:44:55.673 --> 00:44:59.517
put all of the the personal
touch. The last touch of the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31594-2
00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:03.226
file. I mean, it sounds like
we're close to that with.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31602-0
00:45:02.696 --> 00:45:05.306
Yeah, no it dude dude hit the
blame tab.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31611-0
00:45:05.046 --> 00:45:07.046
Yeah, so it's so much better
now.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31607-0
00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:06.346
OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31613-0
00:45:07.756 --> 00:45:08.406
OK, great.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31620-0
00:45:09.776 --> 00:45:10.886
You don't need a separate tool.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31634-0
00:45:11.266 --> 00:45:13.890
Yeah, just just go to the blame
tab and it's right in front of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31634-1
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.056
you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31680-0
00:45:20.086 --> 00:45:24.410
Problem with the blame in the OS
repo is that we sometimes, well,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31680-1
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.209
we've switched, switched from
the OS to the OS 2020 repo.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31680-2
00:45:28.209 --> 00:45:30.436
Before that we came from us
from.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31691-0
00:45:31.146 --> 00:45:33.176
A source steco and watch lot.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31735-0
00:45:33.816 --> 00:45:38.418
And get blaming 80 old blame
cannot go as far back as the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31735-1
00:45:38.418 --> 00:45:43.337
last refactor, but research is
able to stitch the history all

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31735-2
00:45:43.337 --> 00:45:47.780
the way to the beginning of
source depot. Unfortunately

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31735-3
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.446
doesn't get to slime.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31762-0
00:45:50.196 --> 00:45:54.552
But you can go all the way to
source depot, which is pretty

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31762-1
00:45:54.552 --> 00:45:59.126
neat. The disadvantage is that
it does not show you the lines.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-0
00:46:00.396 --> 00:46:04.846
Like you know the blame tab on
on 80 is amazing because you can

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-1
00:46:04.846 --> 00:46:09.226
actually see you know from this
line to this line. It was this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-2
00:46:09.226 --> 00:46:13.606
person and it was this PR. While
the research just gives you a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-3
00:46:13.606 --> 00:46:18.125
list of all the the changes that
went into that file as a whole.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-4
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:22.575
But at least it goes, you know
it transverses all mechanisms of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-5
00:46:22.575 --> 00:46:27.094
source management that Microsoft
ever used in the last. You know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31853-6
00:46:27.094 --> 00:46:29.666
three decades or so. So that's
nice.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31867-0
00:46:30.256 --> 00:46:34.345
Picture here's a tip. Highlight
some lines of code and then say

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31867-1
00:46:34.345 --> 00:46:35.686
history of selection.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31870-0
00:46:37.576 --> 00:46:38.346
On research

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31872-0
00:46:38.606 --> 00:46:39.036
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31892-0
00:46:39.676 --> 00:46:42.720
nice so you can actually filter
by lines. Oh, this is amazing. I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31892-1
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.406
will see I learned something
today.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31933-0
00:46:46.076 --> 00:46:48.657
I actually didn't know research
would go back that far, and I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31933-1
00:46:48.657 --> 00:46:51.320
remember when we first migrated
that there was a different tool

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31933-2
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.776
that would adapt so that you
could like try to do a single

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31933-3
00:46:53.776 --> 00:46:54.566
search and go back.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31969-0
00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:59.057
Oh, and I I know I used to use
the tool before we had blame,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31969-1
00:46:59.057 --> 00:47:02.883
but I now it's been so long
apparently I don't remember was

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31969-2
00:47:02.883 --> 00:47:04.796
it SCPR I just don't remember.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31981-0
00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.715
I have thrown out all of my
memory of all of these various

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31981-1
00:47:08.715 --> 00:47:09.036
tools.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31984-0
00:47:12.566 --> 00:47:13.376
Yeah, well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31999-0
00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:18.654
One tool to rule them all will
be the the best innovation of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/31999-1
00:47:18.654 --> 00:47:19.116
the century.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32020-0
00:47:22.276 --> 00:47:25.015
Now what happens is we we make
we centralized everything into

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32020-1
00:47:25.015 --> 00:47:26.826
one tool and then the tool goes
offline.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32030-0
00:47:28.646 --> 00:47:30.516
Running on somebody step box
and.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32029-0
00:47:30.586 --> 00:47:31.056
Yes.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32034-0
00:47:31.566 --> 00:47:32.576
And they went on vacation,
sorry.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32042-0
00:47:34.536 --> 00:47:37.026
OK, other questions here or
follow-ups.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32072-0
00:47:52.306 --> 00:47:56.210
Came here, Jeff is since the
time for your pitch for feedback

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32072-1
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:59.736
on the course. Now they're at
Friday afternoon at 3:40.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-0
00:48:04.476 --> 00:48:07.781
Sure we can. We can make that
pitch. It is that now what I had

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-1
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:11.085
wanted to do. So this will be
add this to the next time around

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-2
00:48:11.085 --> 00:48:14.285
because I wanted to put a survey
out, but I I didn't get one

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-3
00:48:14.285 --> 00:48:17.485
together. But hey, we got the
rest of the stuff together. So

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-4
00:48:17.485 --> 00:48:20.789
celebrate progress those short
of perfection. But there is the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-5
00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:24.041
training feedback channel. I
definitely would encourage folks

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-6
00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:26.716
to use that. We're going to use
that to kick off a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-7
00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:29.706
retrospective. We're still,
we'll put together the exact

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-8
00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:32.958
details around it, but obviously
whoever is involved, whoever

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32194-9
00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:34.846
wants to be involved in helping
us.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32207-0
00:48:35.326 --> 00:48:38.530
Learn from this and improve it.
There'll be an opportunity to do

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32207-1
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:38.776
that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32210-0
00:48:39.636 --> 00:48:40.286
Uhm?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-0
00:48:41.736 --> 00:48:45.180
I feel like there was one other
thing I wanted to cover on this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-1
00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.571
uhm. I guess if there is like
you know, if you want to give me

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-2
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:51.369
feedback that I can a
centralized and anonymize you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-3
00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:54.706
can send me email directly and
I'll consolidate that up. It's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-4
00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:58.203
like if you don't want to put it
on the teams channel. That's my

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32284-5
00:48:58.203 --> 00:48:58.526
point.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32299-0
00:48:59.156 --> 00:49:02.829
I'm happy to take it that way as
well. Constructive feedback,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32299-1
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:04.606
good feedback. We want it all.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32340-0
00:49:06.546 --> 00:49:10.449
This is I know I said at the
beginning. I'll reinforce it

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32340-1
00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:14.823
here that that that this is the
sustainable way that we're going

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32340-2
00:49:14.823 --> 00:49:18.591
to stay up to date with the
moving technology. You know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32340-3
00:49:18.591 --> 00:49:19.196
there is.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32397-0
00:49:20.376 --> 00:49:24.383
We have relied so much on tribal
knowledge and This Is Us trying

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32397-1
00:49:24.383 --> 00:49:28.205
to break free of that capture as
much as we can, knowing it's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32397-2
00:49:28.205 --> 00:49:32.150
never going to be perfect, but
keep iterating on it so you know

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32397-3
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.602
you're part of a living
education process of continuing

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32397-4
00:49:35.602 --> 00:49:36.526
education that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32465-0
00:49:37.156 --> 00:49:40.834
Us getting you more ramped up on
it eventually. You're gonna find

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32465-1
00:49:40.834 --> 00:49:44.344
yourself sitting in as the SMEs
for one of these going forward

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32465-2
00:49:44.344 --> 00:49:47.687
and it's, you know, it's the
students becoming the teachers

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32465-3
00:49:47.687 --> 00:49:51.142
the sustainable way to do this
is that it is us learning from

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32465-4
00:49:51.142 --> 00:49:53.426
this group and then teaching
this group.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32499-0
00:49:55.246 --> 00:49:57.883
So I appreciate you all for
being willing to be part of

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32499-1
00:49:57.883 --> 00:50:00.473
this, and obviously to the SMB
and the facilitators. I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32499-2
00:50:00.473 --> 00:50:03.156
appreciate the time in helping
to spread that education.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32513-0
00:50:05.916 --> 00:50:09.318
Jamie Abolaji anything you want
to add Fabians on anything you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32513-1
00:50:09.318 --> 00:50:09.966
want to add.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32517-0
00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:15.966
You said it well.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32520-0
00:50:17.006 --> 00:50:17.556
Thank you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32543-0
00:50:23.006 --> 00:50:26.831
And since the the fun stories,
the anecdotes always went over

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32543-1
00:50:26.831 --> 00:50:27.756
well, is there?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32551-0
00:50:28.566 --> 00:50:31.056
One awesome anecdote to leave
this group with.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32581-0
00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:46.544
Here's a question, and in the
chat is Windows 10 internals a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32581-1
00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:49.533
follow up course to this? I
actually didn't know that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32581-2
00:50:49.533 --> 00:50:49.976
existed.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-0
00:50:53.476 --> 00:50:56.560
Yeah, that could be one. I mean
we discussed we discovered there

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32591-0
00:50:53.696 --> 00:50:54.666
You on the floor.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-1
00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.454
was some duplicative content in
some newer versions, so that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-2
00:50:59.454 --> 00:51:02.395
that's certainly going to be one
thing that we we look at. We

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-3
00:51:02.395 --> 00:51:05.431
built this curriculum a little
over a year ago. I think they've

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-4
00:51:05.431 --> 00:51:08.467
since then. There were updates
that have been out there that we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32645-5
00:51:08.467 --> 00:51:09.226
need to look at.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32655-0
00:51:11.446 --> 00:51:12.796
I think Jamie you're gonna say
something there.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32659-0
00:51:13.446 --> 00:51:14.456
Yeah, yeah so.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32704-0
00:51:15.446 --> 00:51:18.886
The plural on Pluralsight.
There's a a lot of videos, so

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32704-1
00:51:18.886 --> 00:51:22.628
there's the windows internals
and Windows 10 videos which are

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32704-2
00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:26.068
just two of many. Many like
definitely everybody. Take a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32704-3
00:51:26.068 --> 00:51:29.146
look at Pluralsight, a lot of
great content there.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32742-0
00:51:31.376 --> 00:51:35.152
As Jeff was saying, like last
year, when we did the first

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32742-1
00:51:35.152 --> 00:51:39.059
instance of our in-house Windows
internal training, we were

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32742-2
00:51:39.059 --> 00:51:42.834
leveraging content that was
available on Pluralsight, the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32742-3
00:51:42.834 --> 00:51:44.006
Windows internals.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32746-0
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:46.416
Content was a.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32772-0
00:51:47.236 --> 00:51:52.461
Much more expensive than the
Windows 10 content, Windows 10

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32772-1
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:57.946
was a like a a shorter bridge.
Follow up on Windows internals.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32793-0
00:51:58.556 --> 00:52:03.740
And so when we you know selected
the various videos to use, we

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32793-1
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.056
largely use the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32813-0
00:52:06.546 --> 00:52:10.706
The video is from the original
Windows internals course because

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32813-1
00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:12.656
it went in through more depth.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32839-0
00:52:13.446 --> 00:52:17.512
There was maybe one or two
videos total from the Windows 10

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32839-1
00:52:17.512 --> 00:52:21.036
section where we viewed that
those were completely.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32849-0
00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:25.376
Replacing the Windows internal
content.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32866-0
00:52:35.106 --> 00:52:38.426
Jeff, you want me to go ahead
and link the feedback options on

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32866-1
00:52:38.426 --> 00:52:38.636
the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32870-0
00:52:39.566 --> 00:52:40.376
In the channel.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32885-0
00:52:41.136 --> 00:52:44.177
Yeah, you're talking bout the
the channel feedback channel

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32934-0
00:52:43.876 --> 00:52:46.406
Yep, but the general channel
distance that there are people

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32885-1
00:52:44.177 --> 00:52:44.486
sharp.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32934-1
00:52:46.406 --> 00:52:48.894
or have been going if other
people are like me and they've

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32899-0
00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:47.096
Yep.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32934-2
00:52:48.894 --> 00:52:51.676
pinned the general channel so it
teams makes it super hard for to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32934-3
00:52:51.676 --> 00:52:53.826
go to the generic team from
there for some reason.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32950-0
00:52:56.046 --> 00:52:58.545
Oh, unless somebody has a tip on
how teams doesn't make it hard

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32950-1
00:52:58.545 --> 00:52:58.896
for them.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32956-0
00:53:00.366 --> 00:53:02.056
Re open to teams tips.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32959-0
00:53:03.026 --> 00:53:04.096
Uhm, yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32961-0
00:53:05.486 --> 00:53:05.956
He

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32966-0
00:53:07.826 --> 00:53:09.346
OS deep dive on.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/32972-0
00:53:10.066 --> 00:53:11.456
I'm 64 X OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33015-0
00:53:12.976 --> 00:53:16.918
I realized after post having
posted that that folks might not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33015-1
00:53:16.918 --> 00:53:20.414
actually have access, so we
might need to download it,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33015-2
00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:24.101
republish it so that folks
actually have access. It's not

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33015-3
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:24.546
in the.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-0
00:53:26.026 --> 00:53:30.582
Plug so we have an OS deep dive
series. You know where we where.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-1
00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:34.858
We have seen a subject matter
experts you know a come in. Do

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-2
00:53:34.858 --> 00:53:39.343
deep dives on you know various
topics in their top of mine, but

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-3
00:53:39.343 --> 00:53:43.969
one of those you know was Pedro.
Did an ARM 64 X, you know at the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-4
00:53:43.969 --> 00:53:48.455
time you know we record all of
those you know we have somewhere

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33095-5
00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:49.716
which I will find.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33105-0
00:53:51.736 --> 00:53:57.176
A page that lists them all, and
so that's another resource.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33117-0
00:53:58.246 --> 00:54:00.996
The you know folks might find
useful.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33127-0
00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:07.336
For questioning.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-0
00:54:06.456 --> 00:54:09.782
When I dropped into chat in case
people weren't aware of this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-1
00:54:09.782 --> 00:54:12.946
this team, we it intentionally
made. This team is a public

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-2
00:54:12.946 --> 00:54:16.325
team. It's it's accessible to
everybody in the company of this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-3
00:54:16.325 --> 00:54:19.812
curriculum. The syllabus that we
have here and all the Q&amp;A S

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-4
00:54:19.812 --> 00:54:23.084
are all added to that syllabus.
Send that out to whoever you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-5
00:54:23.084 --> 00:54:26.248
want. We I've already seen
people in my building that have

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-6
00:54:26.248 --> 00:54:29.627
been passing it around do that.
I mean, it's that's the beauty

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-7
00:54:29.627 --> 00:54:32.685
of what we've built here is this
is not tribal, this was

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-8
00:54:32.685 --> 00:54:36.225
persisted. They can even see the
Q&amp;A. They can access the the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33231-9
00:54:36.225 --> 00:54:36.546
chats.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33245-0
00:54:37.056 --> 00:54:40.446
Uh, and and do independent study
version of this. So definitely

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33245-1
00:54:40.446 --> 00:54:41.346
pass that around.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33270-0
00:54:50.976 --> 00:54:53.994
So if anybody else had any
questions that popped up while

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33270-1
00:54:53.994 --> 00:54:56.126
Jeff was going on and off now
I'm sorry.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33275-0
00:54:57.586 --> 00:54:58.576
Droning on

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33294-0
00:55:01.536 --> 00:55:04.154
I I do wanna get let's say it's
not. I mean we still have time.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33294-1
00:55:04.154 --> 00:55:05.626
So if people have questions we
can.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33302-0
00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:07.496
100% still take them.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-0
00:55:08.796 --> 00:55:11.782
and one thing, if you well
there's a few little cool things

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-1
00:55:11.782 --> 00:55:14.768
that happened here. I want to
highlight to make sure people

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-2
00:55:14.768 --> 00:55:17.456
caught it because it's
important. First of all, E how

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-3
00:55:17.456 --> 00:55:20.591
he invented something new here
because he's self emoji did he?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-4
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:23.278
Was he reacted as he was
talking? He put his surprise

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-5
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:26.364
face up 'cause he was trying to
turn off his hands up, but he

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-6
00:55:26.364 --> 00:55:29.549
actually did. But that's cool. I
don't. I've never seen someone

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-7
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:32.734
self react and I think it's a I.
I was paying attention to what

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-8
00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:35.620
he was saying but then all of a
sudden I became much more

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33434-9
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.506
interested. So that's a a
clever, clever technique. Ehow.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33481-0
00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:42.050
I'm not sure if I could even
pull that off knowing what you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33481-1
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:45.132
did. I don't like. I can't talk
and operate a UI, that's what

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33457-0
00:55:43.066 --> 00:55:43.636
Like

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33481-2
00:55:45.132 --> 00:55:48.016
that's why. I have these, but
they're much easier for me.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33471-0
00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:45.896
team?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33493-0
00:55:51.046 --> 00:55:51.636
Yeah, OK.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33540-0
00:55:51.686 --> 00:55:56.324
Clicking on the wrong part I I
actually have an anecdote. It's

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33500-0
00:55:54.236 --> 00:55:54.606
Like it?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33540-1
00:55:56.324 --> 00:56:00.888
not the the the most awesome
anecdote of this entry, but uhm,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33540-2
00:56:00.888 --> 00:56:05.378
so I I started working Visual
Studio and then I went to what

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33540-3
00:56:05.378 --> 00:56:09.206
was then Digital Media division
which was separate.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-0
00:56:09.776 --> 00:56:14.636
Uhm Enventually Multimedia
became part of windows and dumb

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-1
00:56:14.636 --> 00:56:19.495
I I ended up working on the
audio stack as we were lifting

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-2
00:56:19.495 --> 00:56:24.437
it out of kernel mode into user
mode so I had a big part in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-3
00:56:24.437 --> 00:56:29.379
writing the audio engine in
Windows and the way audio works

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-4
00:56:29.379 --> 00:56:34.567
is it takes a little bit of a
sample of a sound we call a wave

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33612-5
00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:35.226
and PCM.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33637-0
00:56:35.746 --> 00:56:40.478
Uhm, and we deliver that to the
engine that processes and in

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33637-1
00:56:40.478 --> 00:56:44.046
various ways and then sends it
to the driver.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33650-0
00:56:45.066 --> 00:56:50.194
Every 10 milliseconds uhm. And
so this this thing actually

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33650-1
00:56:50.194 --> 00:56:50.976
wakes up.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33669-0
00:56:51.646 --> 00:56:55.123
Come on a timer every 10
milliseconds and process it.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33669-1
00:56:55.123 --> 00:56:56.796
Yes, thank you. I'm Pedro.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33695-0
00:56:57.236 --> 00:57:01.299
Uhm and so. And this runs on all
the Windows machines, and so I'm

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33695-1
00:57:01.299 --> 00:57:04.746
fond of telling people that
software that I wrote runs.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33713-0
00:57:05.506 --> 00:57:10.745
At least billions of times a
day. And so I really, you know,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33713-1
00:57:10.745 --> 00:57:11.346
really.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-0
00:57:13.016 --> 00:57:16.566
I've been really grateful for
the opportunity you know to work

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-1
00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:20.228
on something that has this much
impact on life, so I just really

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-2
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:23.552
just really, really enjoyed
being on iOS developer because

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-3
00:57:23.552 --> 00:57:26.988
it just has so much impact on
people's lives. And it was the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-4
00:57:26.988 --> 00:57:30.425
one thing I worked on in my
career. Well, that could explain

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-5
00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:34.144
to people who weren't, you know,
computer people, what it is that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-6
00:57:34.144 --> 00:57:37.693
I actually did at Microsoft and
it was the one and only time I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-7
00:57:37.693 --> 00:57:40.735
can explain what I did at
Microsoft to lay people. So

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33828-8
00:57:40.735 --> 00:57:42.256
anyway, that's my anecdote.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33873-0
00:57:48.196 --> 00:57:51.916
Thank you for not here, that's
awesome. The other thing I

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33873-1
00:57:51.916 --> 00:57:55.893
wanted that was less comical
about things to pay attention to

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33873-2
00:57:55.893 --> 00:57:59.548
happening here. Eho still
appreciate the emoji thing was

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33873-3
00:57:59.548 --> 00:58:00.446
the fact that.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-0
00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:04.477
Uh, the questions that were
being asked here. If you notice

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-1
00:58:04.477 --> 00:58:07.823
they didn't all come from just
the participants. The subject

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-2
00:58:07.823 --> 00:58:11.224
matter experts are saying, oh
oh, I didn't know that. I mean,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-3
00:58:11.224 --> 00:58:14.296
I just just in the last 30
minutes the different things

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-4
00:58:14.296 --> 00:58:17.642
said it was. I didn't know that
I didn't know that this is a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-5
00:58:17.642 --> 00:58:21.207
very complex space, as evidenced
by people who have been in this

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-6
00:58:21.207 --> 00:58:24.498
code, for, you know, decades at
in. In some cases that that

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-7
00:58:24.498 --> 00:58:27.734
don't know. And so the that
should reinforce for those who

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/33974-8
00:58:27.734 --> 00:58:30.696
all like we we kind of have this
natural tendency to.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-0
00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:34.710
I I don't want to ask the
question, you know I I asked the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-1
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:38.522
question we like we all benefit
from it, you know. So there's a

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-2
00:58:38.522 --> 00:58:42.154
in in our team. I'll drop one
more chat here which is in our

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-3
00:58:42.154 --> 00:58:45.787
team. We say ask questions until
we tell you to stop and the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-4
00:58:45.787 --> 00:58:49.420
punchline of that is we won't
tell you to stop. It's the you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34052-5
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.266
know, it's the we are learning.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34107-0
00:58:52.016 --> 00:58:55.105
We are here to help other people
grow and you'll be in the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34107-1
00:58:55.105 --> 00:58:58.141
position later on where you're
going to be doing the same

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34107-2
00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:01.178
thing. So you we want to hear
the questions seek out, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34107-3
00:59:01.178 --> 00:59:04.371
know, use this training, but
then ask the questions that the

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34107-4
00:59:04.371 --> 00:59:06.046
training doesn't answer for you.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34128-0
00:59:08.816 --> 00:59:13.011
Yeah, I I just wanted to say
that later can mean right now

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34115-0
00:59:09.226 --> 00:59:09.596
Bill.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34121-0
00:59:10.596 --> 00:59:10.916
Yep.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34128-1
00:59:13.011 --> 00:59:13.366
also.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-0
00:59:14.696 --> 00:59:18.355
'cause I'm sure there's there's
a ton of stuff that you already

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-1
00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:21.728
know. You know that you could
just put in a wiki page, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-2
00:59:21.728 --> 00:59:25.043
know, and someone will be
grateful enough for having seen

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-3
00:59:25.043 --> 00:59:28.416
it written down. And a lot of
work. The resources that you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-4
00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:31.731
know that we're drawing upon
here came from that. It came

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34208-5
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:33.446
from someone taking, you know.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34264-0
00:59:34.526 --> 00:59:38.230
But their knowledge, you know,
making it available more broadly

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34264-1
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:41.876
so our our our other mantras,
leaders, teaching, doing so, you

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34264-2
00:59:41.876 --> 00:59:44.944
know, like simply knowing
something that that person

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34264-3
00:59:44.944 --> 00:59:48.416
behind it doesn't know makes you
at leader issued teach it.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34267-0
00:59:51.876 --> 00:59:52.126
Right?

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34275-0
00:59:55.296 --> 00:59:57.436
Friday afternoon and it is not
raining.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34280-0
00:59:58.896 --> 00:59:59.936
We call it a week.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34319-0
01:00:01.316 --> 01:00:04.189
And and for those who as soon as
we leave the call, we're like,

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34288-0
01:00:02.046 --> 01:00:02.436
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34319-1
01:00:04.189 --> 01:00:06.837
oh, I was about to raise my
hand. But the channel is still

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34319-2
01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:09.126
there. You can. You can continue
asking questions.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34321-0
01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:10.246
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34336-0
01:00:12.556 --> 01:00:15.753
All of these subject matter
experts don't disappear. This is

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34336-1
01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:16.906
building your network.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34362-0
01:00:17.696 --> 01:00:20.629
All participants can go outside
and enjoy the beautiful weekend

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34362-1
01:00:20.629 --> 01:00:22.736
but subject matter experts. Stay
here, sorry.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34359-0
01:00:22.026 --> 01:00:22.366
Yeah.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34363-0
01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:24.066
No.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34404-0
01:00:25.566 --> 01:00:28.987
Even more to the point, all of
the participants know our names

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34404-1
01:00:28.987 --> 01:00:32.407
now, so you're free to don't.
Don't don't hit me on chat, I'll

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34404-2
01:00:32.407 --> 01:00:34.796
never see it. You can send me
email though.

676c0374-a9c1-4546-9efd-4aa45f00a481/34425-0
01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:40.697
Yeah, I'll give classes on the
managing your your inbox and
