6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1754-0
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.916
So that's how the employee can
deliver what?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-0
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.890
The impact is and the employee
can influence how this impact is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-1
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.851
delivered by being open to
feedback by asking the feedback,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-2
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:27.141
talking to their peers, manager,
et cetera, to understand how to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-3
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:31.102
find tune home the work the
employee does. You can actively

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-4
00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:34.666
actually create an inclusive
work environment so that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-5
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.561
everybody in the team has a
sense of belonging and can put

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-6
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.587
their best foot forward. And
finally, beyond the lookout for

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1839-7
00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:46.416
opportunities, all that each
point of time to understand.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1867-0
00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.418
How can you not only do your own
work, but also contribute

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1867-1
00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:54.027
towards others? Success and
leverage other people's work?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1867-2
00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:57.699
Start says somebody of how to
employee can influence their

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1867-3
00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.434
rewards right by influencing
what is delivered and how it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1867-4
00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:02.056
delivered.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1881-0
00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.898
With this, let me hand over to
Puneet to talk about the rewards

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1881-1
00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:09.786
overview process.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1903-0
00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:13.864
So to summarize, the PND
philosophy for Microsoft is one

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1903-1
00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:17.646
side of the coin and the rewards
is the other side of the coin.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1908-0
00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:33.706
Alright, thank you Abhishek.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-0
00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:37.820
So I think the logical segue
from the last section is now

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-1
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.067
Abhishek talked about the
objectives behind this whole

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-2
00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:44.549
process and we're gonna switch
gears and talk a little bit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-3
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.327
about the actual process itself.
What happens. I think a lot of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-4
00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:51.692
people in the team are fairly
new, so they wouldn't have

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-5
00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:55.588
really understood like the whole
process. And does it happen over

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-6
00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:59.189
weeks or months and you know
what exactly happens as part of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-7
00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.554
the process. So we're gonna go
through that now and it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/1982-8
00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:05.506
interesting like it's it's it's
beyond 15 August.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-0
00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:08.765
A lot of you would know that
this is the the rewards time, so

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-1
00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:12.027
no even more opportune because
this is the right time for us to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-2
00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:15.339
be on the same page in terms of
how the process works, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-3
00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.447
we'll talk about this. So the
first thing I want to start by

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-4
00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:21.657
is talking about what are the
guiding principles that managers

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-5
00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:24.919
follow in deciding rewards. One
of the most important questions

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-6
00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.027
that people might have on their
mind is how am I rewards are

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-7
00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:31.237
determined? What does my manager
really thinking? What sort of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-8
00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:33.989
things that they're evaluating
me on and what are the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2076-9
00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.416
principles that they follow.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2099-0
00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:39.901
So I want to talk about four
very important principles. A lot

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2099-1
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:43.389
of these often come as
questions. Also, either people

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2099-2
00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.296
have. So the first one is 1 year
one reward.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-0
00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:50.355
I think this is very important
because uh, very often, you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-1
00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:53.811
know, people will feel like,
hey, I I'm doing a lot of work

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-2
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:57.440
close to my reward cycle when
the discussions happen, but then

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-3
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.012
I did a lot of work earlier in
the year as well. Then there's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-4
00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:04.122
my manager, still remember all
the work that happened

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2161-5
00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:07.406
throughout the year. The short
answer is absolutely yes.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-0
00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.247
Like you're rewards cycle
process has to be about the work

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-1
00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:14.301
that you've done across the
whole year, right? So making

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-2
00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:17.516
sure that everything that's
happened in the air is actually

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-3
00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:20.945
accounted for. Your manager is
actually taking into account all

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-4
00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.106
your contributions throughout
the year. There is a counter

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-5
00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:27.642
thing that also happens to this.
There are people feel like, hey,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-6
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:30.964
maybe last year I I hadn't done
well. Is that going to impact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-7
00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:34.340
what I did this year? And the
answer is like, no, because this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2241-8
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.876
year rewards are gonna be purely
about what you did in this year.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-0
00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:41.032
And then the definition of the
year in this case, because it

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-1
00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:43.891
discussion really happen in
around May, June timeframe is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-2
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:47.144
the fiscal year definition which
is you know the June to may time

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-3
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.101
frame. So that's what one year
one reward stands for right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-4
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.255
We're making sure that only the
things that you've done in this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-5
00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:56.064
year are the ones that really
impact and there's no Halo

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-6
00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:59.317
effect. It's not like the things
that you've done in the last two

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-7
00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:02.225
months have a greater impact
than what you've done earlier

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-8
00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:04.935
months. So that's very
important. Second is predefined

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2314-9
00:04:04.935 --> 00:04:05.576
distribution.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-0
00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:09.741
Is it that you know if you're
coming into a meeting like this,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-1
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:13.210
you already have to fit people
into some curve like the short

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-2
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.623
answer is, no, that's not the
case. There used to be a time,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-3
00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:20.204
and there are places elsewhere
in the industry where the system

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-4
00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:23.561
a norm, but in Microsoft now
that's not the norm, right? We

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-5
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.086
don't do that, which means to
say, it's not like if you have a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-6
00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:30.332
team of X people, then at
percent, people have to be, you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-7
00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:33.857
know, an average dating only 10%
can be exceptional and things

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2405-8
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:37.046
like that. Like that's there's
nothing like that. Right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-0
00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:40.550
There's no predefined curve
right, but the reality is that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-1
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.029
there is a budget right? It's
not like, you know, teams have

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-2
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.679
unlimited budget, so you can you
can basically give any rewards

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-3
00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.929
that you want eventually and
I'll talk about this in the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-4
00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:54.237
process. There is an annual
budget that gets decided both

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-5
00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:57.487
for merit increases and for
promotion. And you know it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-6
00:04:57.487 --> 00:05:00.795
every organization groups
responsibility to fit the whole

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-7
00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:04.159
organization as part of that
budget, right. So that's very

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2475-8
00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.296
important. So there is no
predefined distribution but.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2493-0
00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:11.126
The actual rewards that that get
distributed account for the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2493-1
00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:14.596
overall budget that gets
allocated to their organization.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2497-0
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.316
3rd is like no ratings.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-0
00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:21.498
Uh, I think there was probably.
There was a time in 2000s or

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-1
00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:24.846
maybe if I'm mistaken, two other
people who've been there where

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-2
00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:28.143
they used to be actual ratings
that used to be given to people

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-3
00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:31.387
and it's an industry as well,
this one, this one particularly

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-4
00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:34.683
reminds me of that. Amir Khan
seen in three idiots right there

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-5
00:05:34.683 --> 00:05:37.875
when he tops the exam and he
sits in front with the director

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-6
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.276
and his friends are at the back
bench and he questions like, you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-7
00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:44.206
know, I don't have to do this.
And that's literally the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-8
00:05:44.206 --> 00:05:47.450
philosophy like, you know, you
don't. I mean there's there is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2673-9
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.276
no way you can drive and
inclusive culture of growth.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-0
00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:53.660
If you're giving people like
ratings and saying like, hey,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-1
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.695
this is your rating, this is
your rating. So the company is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-2
00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:59.679
actually doing has done away
with that. There's no rating,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-3
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:02.157
right. It's important for
managers to be able to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-4
00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:05.141
articulate how somebody's
performing. And also at the same

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-5
00:06:05.141 --> 00:06:08.125
time reflected in terms of
rewards. But beyond that, there

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-6
00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:11.362
is no rating that is given to an
individual, right? Just wanted

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-7
00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:14.549
to be sure that that's the case.
The 4th one. Abhishek already

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2741-8
00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.926
touched upon higher rewards for
higher impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2779-0
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.557
See, the reality is all of us
have gone through very similar

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2779-1
00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:24.620
interview process. There are
amazingly talented people in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2779-2
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.947
Microsoft. All your peers are
talented, which is great, right?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2779-3
00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:31.168
That's the type of company we
want. And so in an environment

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2779-4
00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:31.696
like this.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-0
00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:35.865
Like Abhishek was saying, there
are important things. The three

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-1
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:39.225
circles that he showed about
being able to utilize somebody's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-2
00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:42.639
work to be able to build on it,
you contributing to somebody's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-3
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.000
work and then our individual
impact to business. All of these

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-4
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.198
significantly matter and people
who sort of driven higher,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-5
00:06:49.198 --> 00:06:52.341
exceptional outcomes based on
those are the ones that are

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-6
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:55.756
typically going to get higher
rewards than others, right. So I

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-7
00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:58.737
think the philosophy of
differentiation, the fact that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-8
00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.392
if somebody has done
exceptionally well on those

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2855-9
00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:01.826
circles.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2865-0
00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:05.556
Uh is is something that is
factored in as part of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2865-1
00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:06.276
conversation?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2876-0
00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:10.316
Yeah, I'm guessing there no
question on the chat so far.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-0
00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:15.076
Alright, awesome. So uh, with
with that in mind, we'll move to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-1
00:07:15.076 --> 00:07:18.538
the actual process itself,
right? And a little bit of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-2
00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.821
timelines and we'll deep dive
into it now to start the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-3
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:25.343
process, right. It's very
important for first for managers

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-4
00:07:25.343 --> 00:07:28.804
to have or form a basis of how
everybody on their team is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-5
00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:32.445
doing, right and how do they do
that? They have to determine

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-6
00:07:32.445 --> 00:07:36.086
impact for every individual on
their team and they rely on a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-7
00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:39.668
number of data sources to be
able to do that. And I'm going

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-8
00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.130
to quickly move ahead and just
talk about what these data

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/2966-9
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.846
sources are.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-0
00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:47.481
Right. So managers, when they
look at their teams, they're

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-1
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:50.995
going to look at a bunch of data
sources to understand how

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-2
00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:54.808
somebody is doing, right. So one
example is connects, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-3
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:58.502
I'm gonna simply talk about four
things as individuals that I

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-4
00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:02.314
think you should all know. Think
about that get triangulated to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3008-5
00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.876
forming, you know, your
assessment one is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3014-0
00:08:05.606 --> 00:08:07.446
It's very important to know your
career stage.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-0
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:11.109
And your whole profile like, you
know, a senior engineer versus

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-1
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:13.839
you know, an SDE two may have
different role profiles and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-2
00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:16.899
different set of challenges that
they're working towards, right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-3
00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:19.818
So first of all, as employees,
it's very important for you to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-4
00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:22.784
know at your career stage what's
your profile and what sort of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3067-5
00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:25.326
our appropriate level
appropriate challenges for you.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3082-0
00:08:26.096 --> 00:08:29.007
Based on that, you are actually
going to work with the manager

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3082-1
00:08:29.007 --> 00:08:30.486
and define your core priorities.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-0
00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:34.765
Those core priorities really go
into your connect, you have your

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-1
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.783
connect is basically an archival
of the core priorities and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-2
00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.801
deliverables that you and your
manager have together agreed

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-3
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:43.718
upon that you're going to
deliver in the next six months.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-4
00:08:43.718 --> 00:08:46.786
And then you're gonna again
revisit in six months, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-5
00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:49.553
you understand your core profile
role profile and your

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3133-6
00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:50.106
challenges.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-0
00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:53.775
You have decided your core
priorities based on that with

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-1
00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:56.891
your manager, which is, you
know, the connect and then you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-2
00:08:56.891 --> 00:09:00.058
have regular one on ones with
the managers in some of these

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-3
00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:03.121
you know you also get feedback
real time feedback and how

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-4
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.130
you're doing towards that. So
the first one which is the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-5
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.404
connects and the one on ones
becomes a very important element

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3193-6
00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:10.196
that goes into.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-0
00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.925
No, I think that the manager
looks at right. They will

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-1
00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:16.723
basically look at your
contributions and weigh them

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-2
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:20.166
against the core priorities that
you both had decided together,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-3
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:22.803
right? So that's a very
important one. Second is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-4
00:09:22.803 --> 00:09:26.031
informal and formal feedback.
This is where Microsoft being

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-5
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.367
such a large company, a lot of
the work is collaborative. You

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-6
00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:32.702
are most likely not going to be
working in isolation. You are

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-7
00:09:32.702 --> 00:09:35.931
going to be working with many
partners. You know your peers

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-8
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:39.320
across disciplines. So it's very
important for managers to get

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3287-9
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.656
perspectives from other people
who have worked with you also.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-0
00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:45.819
And this can happen both
formally and informally. You

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-1
00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:49.200
know, there's a tool in which
you can share perspective and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-2
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.919
you can also see what others are
talking about, your interactions

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-3
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:56.357
and how they enjoyed working
with you. And this can be given

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-4
00:09:56.357 --> 00:09:59.682
informally also to a manager
just in person. So that's the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-5
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:03.007
second other important thing
that becomes a very important

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3349-6
00:10:03.007 --> 00:10:06.726
input parameter for a manager to
look. The caveat I would say is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3367-0
00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:10.018
Is the feedback can be
situational, which means you may

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3367-1
00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:13.413
have had different situations
while working with different

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3367-2
00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:13.816
people.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-0
00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:17.714
It's purely up to your manager
to be able to internalize and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-1
00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:20.684
look at that feedback in the
light of you know, what the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-2
00:10:20.684 --> 00:10:23.914
situation might be right? So so
managers have that privilege.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-3
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:27.196
Third is overall observations. I
mean you're, you know, you're

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-4
00:10:27.196 --> 00:10:30.426
working with your manager and
your team, the results that you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-5
00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:33.448
have achieved like objectives
thing, it's about outcomes,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-6
00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:36.782
right. So overall observations
on that and most importantly how

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-7
00:10:36.782 --> 00:10:39.804
the outcomes were achieved is
very important and a single

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-8
00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:42.826
person can achieve the same
results in two very different

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3446-9
00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:45.066
ways, right? Two examples has to
give you.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-0
00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:48.144
One you know, you have an
opportunity to providentially

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-1
00:10:48.144 --> 00:10:51.442
collaborate with the other team
and reuse some components and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-2
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:54.846
work with them and build on it.
Versus you could say like, hey,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-3
00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:57.186
it's going to be very
complicated for me to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-4
00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:00.324
collaborate with them. Let me
just go and build everything

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-5
00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:03.674
from scratch. You may attend,
you may achieve the same results

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-6
00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:06.812
in both cases, but somebody was
actually part of the team,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-7
00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:10.057
collaborated and built on top of
existing tech where it made

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3509-8
00:11:10.057 --> 00:11:10.376
sense.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3547-0
00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:14.079
Uh has had a better how of doing
that, but somebody just, you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3547-1
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:17.179
know, literally duplicating the
sources same way, you know,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3547-2
00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:20.073
like, if there's a complicated
interaction as a product

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3547-3
00:11:20.073 --> 00:11:22.346
manager, you may have had or is
a designer.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-0
00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:26.384
You could say I know no, I'm
gonna manage my stakeholder now

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-1
00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:29.559
how to do it and only escalate
at the right time. The other

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-2
00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:32.629
person could have achieved the
same outcome, but you know

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-3
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:35.698
regularly escalating and
causing, you know, stress across

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-4
00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:38.715
teams and things like that.
Right, so so it's the how is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-5
00:11:38.715 --> 00:11:42.102
very important on how you do it.
And then lastly, insights from

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-6
00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:45.224
people discussions. So that's
the next part we're going to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-7
00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:47.976
come to which is people
discussion and we'll talk a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3627-8
00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:48.876
little bit about.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-0
00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:53.179
What exactly happens in people
discussion, right? So. So yeah.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-1
00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:56.026
So that's the second part,
right? You would have, I mean,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-2
00:11:56.026 --> 00:11:59.119
for those of you in the system
for longer seen sometime around

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-3
00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:02.211
May or June, there are these one
or two days where it suddenly

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-4
00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:05.255
all your managers disappear and
you're thinking like you know

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-5
00:12:05.255 --> 00:12:08.250
one or two days everybody's in
the room and what's happening

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-6
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.048
that's this process, right?
That's the people discussion

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3691-7
00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:11.686
that happens.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3717-0
00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:14.809
That it's a I mean it's
definitely, you know, many hours

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3717-1
00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:17.799
of discussion, but no, all
managers sensually would get

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3717-2
00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:21.002
into a room. So little bit of
like what happens in the room

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3717-3
00:12:21.002 --> 00:12:21.376
really.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3744-0
00:12:22.146 --> 00:12:26.423
Uh manager essentially get
together. The whole idea is to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3744-1
00:12:26.423 --> 00:12:31.143
have objectivity for the process
across the system, which means

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3744-2
00:12:31.143 --> 00:12:34.536
if if one manager is coming up
with a set of.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-0
00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:38.432
A contribution impacts for their
team and another manager is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-1
00:12:38.432 --> 00:12:41.105
coming with their team, making
sure that they're all

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-2
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:44.131
consistent. There's a common
philosophy and objectives that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-3
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:47.309
are being followed and so the
whole purpose of that discussion

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-4
00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:50.234
is essentially to get to a
common understanding. So there

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-5
00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:52.907
are common themes that
everybody's following, right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-6
00:12:52.907 --> 00:12:55.882
It's not distinct between teams,
right? So objectivity and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-7
00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:58.858
fairness are really the the key
goals. I would say for the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-8
00:12:58.858 --> 00:13:01.884
people discussion that happens
now, people discussion don't

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-9
00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:04.708
really mean that every single
individual on the team is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3830-10
00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:05.616
getting discussed.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-0
00:13:05.776 --> 00:13:09.478
In many cases, there are a few
specific examples that might get

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-1
00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:13.295
discussed. You know, somebody's,
you know, maybe spent many years

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-2
00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:16.534
in a role and has significantly
changed in terms of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-3
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:20.178
contribution. It'll be a good
example to discuss with the rest

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-4
00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:23.821
of the team. So there are many
such specific examples that get

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-5
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:27.349
discussed. It's not necessary
that every individual will get

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-6
00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:30.646
discussed, right. So part of
first Step manager uses all

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3896-7
00:13:30.646 --> 00:13:31.456
these sources.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-0
00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:36.123
Makes an impact contribution
assessment for all their team.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-1
00:13:36.123 --> 00:13:39.447
Then the manager walks into the
people discussion with all of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-2
00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:42.503
these so you can think every
manager walks in the people

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-3
00:13:42.503 --> 00:13:45.880
discussion with these so we will
quickly go over that. This is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-4
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.668
just a quick drill down into
what happens in people

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-5
00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:51.938
discussion. Like I said there
was a common understanding and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/3967-6
00:13:51.938 --> 00:13:55.316
everybody comes up with examples
and how to make impact right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-0
00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:59.977
Essential outcome is you know
you should have awareness so

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-1
00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:03.307
that both promotion and merit
increase get discussed as part

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-2
00:14:03.307 --> 00:14:06.801
of that meeting. And what's very
important because other people

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-3
00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:09.859
feel like is promotion at
different discussion is merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-4
00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:13.353
increase at different discussion
no, they both happen as a part

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4017-5
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.646
of these people discuss in the
same room.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-0
00:14:16.506 --> 00:14:19.761
Like so third, like what happens
after people discussion now,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-1
00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:22.754
once the discussion has
happened, managers will actually

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-2
00:14:22.754 --> 00:14:25.747
been a part of that discussion
are going to go back with

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-3
00:14:25.747 --> 00:14:29.003
certain follow-ups, right? It
times that assessments or their

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-4
00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:32.416
recommendations might have been
a little different than what the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-5
00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:35.776
room eventually agreed upon on
things. So they're gonna go back

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-6
00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:38.979
and they're gonna refine their
recommendations based on what

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-7
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:42.130
got decided in the room. Right.
So essentially, this is the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-8
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.280
process of making sure all
managers are aligned and they're

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4107-9
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.116
basically talking the same
language when it comes to.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4122-0
00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:51.683
Benchmarks, but this has
happened. You can imagine like

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4122-1
00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:54.276
at minor abhishek's level we
essentially.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-0
00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:58.758
See latte. The whole team has
gone through this process, right

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-1
00:14:58.758 --> 00:15:02.108
and then we further update,
let's say it goes to, in our

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-2
00:15:02.108 --> 00:15:05.282
case to Rajesh. And so there is
going to be levels of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-3
00:15:05.282 --> 00:15:09.043
organizational leaders who will
have a budget that they have to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-4
00:15:09.043 --> 00:15:12.569
work towards. So this is this
part of this process which is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-5
00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:16.096
called budget reconciliation,
right. So once all of this is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4176-6
00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:16.566
decided.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-0
00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:21.438
Every leader is trying to make
sure that their organization is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-1
00:15:21.438 --> 00:15:25.068
balanced in terms of budget. You
typically need an organization

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-2
00:15:25.068 --> 00:15:28.527
of a reasonable size for you to
say that, hey, I can balance

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-3
00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:31.532
against a budget, but presume
that happens to say at

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-4
00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:34.821
abhishek's level for his
organization that then passes on

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-5
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:38.280
to Rajesh to look at overall
edge to see if he's balanced on

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-6
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.909
budget. And when I say balanced
on budget means every year he's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-7
00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:45.425
going to have a merit budget,
right? And then he's also going

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4263-8
00:15:45.425 --> 00:15:46.956
to have a promotion budget.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4266-0
00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:47.966
This is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4284-0
00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:56.535
Alright, I switching like this
better. Yeah, so this is the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4284-1
00:15:56.535 --> 00:15:59.686
budget reconciliation part. The
4th part of this process.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-0
00:16:00.536 --> 00:16:03.803
And then last part of the
process is basically the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-1
00:16:03.803 --> 00:16:07.839
rewards, the discussion itself,
once the budget reconciliation

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-2
00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:11.682
happens, let's just say Rajesh
is level is goes to Michael,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-3
00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:15.846
Rajesh, chance, Sathya. And then
I think at a company level it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-4
00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:19.370
frozen. And then there is a 6
state beyond. Watch. The

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-5
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.213
snapshot opens, the snapshot is
essentially your the actual

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4338-6
00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:23.726
rewards.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-0
00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.920
They're so so the tool basically
that talks about the actual

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-1
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.482
rewards, opens up for managers
to be able to communicate that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-2
00:16:31.482 --> 00:16:34.929
to their team, right? And that's
the that's the one that is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-3
00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:38.433
talked about, the date that it
happens usually most years is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-4
00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:42.109
August 15th and your rewards get
effective on 1st September. So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-5
00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:45.614
that's how this fifth process
works. And like you would have

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-6
00:16:45.614 --> 00:16:49.290
seen, this is whole like almost
like a three month process like

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-7
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.794
in it starts with May and June
it goes all the way up to the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4416-8
00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:53.886
rewards discussion.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4427-0
00:16:54.336 --> 00:16:58.620
Right. So with that, uh, we can
go on to the common questions in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4427-1
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.016
myths.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4451-0
00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:02.430
Uh, we thought there are a few
questions that we hear a lot

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4451-1
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.463
rather than just opening up the
room, we can start by answering

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4451-2
00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:08.496
some of these and then if there
are more happy to take that on.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-0
00:17:09.846 --> 00:17:13.230
Uh, so the first one is it has
an individual. What can I do to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-1
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.722
earn higher rewards? Right. And
this goes back to the principles

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-2
00:17:16.722 --> 00:17:20.053
that we talked about, like what
principles do managers use to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-3
00:17:20.053 --> 00:17:23.169
decide rewards, right. So first
one is like have frequent

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-4
00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:26.446
discussion with your managers,
using connects. Don't take it

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-5
00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:29.723
literally. Like this doesn't
mean you know if you're meeting

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-6
00:17:29.723 --> 00:17:32.947
a major every week, you're gonna
have good rewards. But the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-7
00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:36.009
essence is that you need to be
in touch with the manager

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-8
00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:39.393
regularly so that your manager
and you are on the same page in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4618-9
00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:42.026
terms of your priorities and how
you're heading.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-0
00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:44.918
I think that's really critical.
You don't want to be in a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-1
00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:47.807
situation where you know after
six months you realize that,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-2
00:17:47.807 --> 00:17:50.792
hey, I was on my own trajectory
in manager. I never singed or

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-3
00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:53.777
no, we we didn't realize that I
was talking towards different

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-4
00:17:53.777 --> 00:17:56.811
goals. So getting our priorities
right and being in touch with

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-5
00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:59.796
your manager regularly on how
you're progressing towards is a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-6
00:17:59.796 --> 00:18:02.588
good thing to do. The second
one, I'm not going to repeat

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-7
00:18:02.588 --> 00:18:05.381
three cycles of the fact we
talked about making sure that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-8
00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:08.269
you know your priorities are
across that for managers, it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-9
00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:11.110
beyond that. It is also the
model coach care that Abhishek

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4705-10
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.736
talked about.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-0
00:18:12.096 --> 00:18:14.822
And then lastly, yeah, your
looking always looking for

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-1
00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:17.797
additional opportunities for you
to create a bigger impact,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-2
00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:20.821
right, not just be siloed to
what you're doing, but you know

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-3
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.845
potential like, hey, can I do
something that's going to help

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-4
00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.918
my team at large? So things like
that are gonna definitely up

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-5
00:18:26.918 --> 00:18:29.942
your chances of earning higher
rewards, they'll give you for

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4753-6
00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:30.686
the second one.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4774-0
00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:36.786
So so we have this alternating
questions between Puneet and me

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4774-1
00:18:36.786 --> 00:18:39.755
for the fact so that we can
hopefully have a balanced view

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4774-2
00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:41.366
for all the questions over here.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4779-0
00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:44.856
Let me go to the next one now.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4782-0
00:18:46.606 --> 00:18:47.376
That was the next one.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4799-0
00:18:48.216 --> 00:18:51.177
All right. So Pritam, I spoke
about this will there was I got

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4799-1
00:18:51.177 --> 00:18:53.566
last year influence for. I'm
gonna get this year.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-0
00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:57.898
And they, PRINCIPAL of here is
the one year wonder what's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-1
00:18:57.898 --> 00:19:01.946
principle right? It's important
to know that it's one year. It's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-2
00:19:01.946 --> 00:19:05.808
not the last two months. It's
how the first three months it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-3
00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:09.482
saw the previous year, it saw
the previous years, it's one

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-4
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:13.593
year one reward, right. And it's
important to note because impact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4862-5
00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:16.956
varies across the years based on
opportunity project.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4882-0
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:21.302
Different circumstances, right?
And the and the work and the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4882-1
00:19:21.302 --> 00:19:25.007
impact that you had this year
will determine your reward this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4882-2
00:19:25.007 --> 00:19:25.306
year.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4884-0
00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:26.196
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4903-0
00:19:28.316 --> 00:19:32.519
And and again to clarify, reward
basically means merit, increase

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4903-1
00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:35.106
bonus and stock award as as
applicable.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4959-0
00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:43.607
Sure. So thank you, bunch of
bunch of employees. We here are

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4959-1
00:19:43.607 --> 00:19:47.513
news. Let me just go a bit more
into detail into what merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4959-2
00:19:47.513 --> 00:19:51.615
increase bonus and stock awards
means right. Merit increase is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4959-3
00:19:51.615 --> 00:19:55.651
an increase in salary. OK. So
that's a percentage increase in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/4959-4
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:58.906
salary every year which is again
based on impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-0
00:19:59.686 --> 00:20:03.382
Bonus is is, is is a percentage
of your bonus eligible salary,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-1
00:20:03.382 --> 00:20:06.902
right? So what this means is
that over the year, what's the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-2
00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:10.246
total salary you have got
working in teams. So if you if

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-3
00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:14.059
you work for the full 12 months,
there are 12 months salaries of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-4
00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:17.637
bonus eligible salary if you
joined later if you join if you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-5
00:20:17.637 --> 00:20:21.392
worked for only eight months in
the team you join Microsoft say

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5017-6
00:20:21.392 --> 00:20:23.856
last year in November or
whatever, right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5050-0
00:20:24.546 --> 00:20:28.655
Then a bonus eligible salary is
your salary from the time you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5050-1
00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:32.299
joined till June this year.
That's your bonus eligible

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5050-2
00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:36.077
salary and a bonus will be
calculated as a percentage of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5050-3
00:20:36.077 --> 00:20:37.866
your bonus eligible salary.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5058-0
00:20:38.546 --> 00:20:42.336
OK. That's the second part of
your reward.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5089-0
00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:47.017
And third party reward is a
stock award, right? And and once

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5089-1
00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:50.951
again based on it each at each
level there's a target Stocker

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5089-2
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:54.822
wall and you get either higher
or as appropriate based on an

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5089-3
00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:55.266
impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5098-0
00:20:55.906 --> 00:21:00.056
Yeah. So these are three aspects
of your of your merit.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5104-0
00:21:00.986 --> 00:21:02.736
Uh. Of your afterwards?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5124-0
00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:10.405
I think the next one that we
hear is I received rewards in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5124-1
00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:11.706
the middle of my arrange.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5148-0
00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:17.077
Is that a good outcome? Uh, the
reality is like, look, I talked

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5148-1
00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:21.219
about, you know, amazingly
talented people in Microsoft,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5148-2
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:23.036
right? And the fact that.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-0
00:21:24.226 --> 00:21:27.195
You already have expectations
that your level and your

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-1
00:21:27.195 --> 00:21:30.327
priorities are set like that,
right? So if you're getting

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-2
00:21:30.327 --> 00:21:33.350
rewards that are expected
rewards, right, you basically

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-3
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.751
you know you're already doing
well at your level, right? So so

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-4
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:40.261
the fact that you've had a great
impact and you're in the middle

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-5
00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:43.716
of the range means that you're
already meeting expectations and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5207-6
00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:45.066
doing well, right? So and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-0
00:21:45.686 --> 00:21:48.462
if you look at statistics and
there are some statistics on the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-1
00:21:48.462 --> 00:21:51.150
pass on the 70% of employees
actually receive rewards in the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-2
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.015
middle of the road, I just want
to be sure, like the word middle

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-3
00:21:54.015 --> 00:21:56.879
doesn't make you feel like, hey,
I'm in the middle. But the fact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-4
00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:59.611
that you are actually meeting
your expectations, you're doing

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-5
00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:02.255
well, you are delivering as per
expectations at your level,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5261-6
00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:02.696
right? So.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5302-0
00:22:03.216 --> 00:22:06.380
Uh, so it is a good outcome.
This is what I would say, but

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5302-1
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.760
obviously there is scope for you
to, you know have exceptional

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5302-2
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.602
rewards. Everybody has a scope
to be able to deliver

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5302-3
00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:16.142
exceptional rewards beyond that,
right. So yeah, I think that the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5302-4
00:22:16.142 --> 00:22:18.556
second one is just a
rearticulation of that.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5350-0
00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:23.459
It is very important for you to
be aware that you and your

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5350-1
00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:26.651
manager understand that you know
these are the priorities set for

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5350-2
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:29.457
you, and that you're meeting
those expectations and doing

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5350-3
00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:32.504
well, and you could very well be
in the middle of the range by

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5350-4
00:22:32.504 --> 00:22:33.616
meeting that right. So.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5352-0
00:22:34.256 --> 00:22:34.766
That on.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-0
00:22:39.786 --> 00:22:43.187
This this is a very common
question that I've seen asked

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-1
00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:46.588
and the past few years right
that people are on leave of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-2
00:22:46.588 --> 00:22:50.406
absence and the question is that
how am I rewards impacted if I

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-3
00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:53.986
took a leave of absence? If I
was out of maternity leave or

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-4
00:22:53.986 --> 00:22:57.685
for some personal situation I
didn't work for three months or

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-5
00:22:57.685 --> 00:23:01.385
leave, how was can I still get
high rewards and the answer is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-6
00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:05.024
yes, it's an unambiguous yes,
right? Because the way that it

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-7
00:23:05.024 --> 00:23:08.664
was a calculated is that that
the your evaluated on the time

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5435-8
00:23:08.664 --> 00:23:10.096
you were working in the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-0
00:23:10.176 --> 00:23:13.800
Working officially in the job,
right, those those number of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-1
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.726
weeks or months when you weren't
working, they aren't even. They

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-2
00:23:17.726 --> 00:23:21.410
aren't even considered. So your
impact is still impact based

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-3
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.974
though. So your impact is
considered based on the time you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-4
00:23:24.974 --> 00:23:28.598
were actively working in the
team and if that if the impact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-5
00:23:28.598 --> 00:23:32.222
in that duration was high, you
will get high rewards if the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5498-6
00:23:32.222 --> 00:23:35.906
impact was lower, you get lower
rewards. Note that the base.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-0
00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:39.737
The bonus eligible salary will
change, though the bonus

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-1
00:23:39.737 --> 00:23:43.115
eligible salary will change
based on your active involvement

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-2
00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:46.437
in the team there. There's a
case of leave of absence where

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-3
00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:49.705
you where you take a leaf
absence without pay for whatever

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-4
00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:53.193
reason. Then the bonus search
will salary will not include the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5561-5
00:23:53.193 --> 00:23:56.516
salary for the time when you
weren't taking salary for the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5564-0
00:23:57.246 --> 00:23:57.796
The company.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5585-0
00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:05.934
No, I think the next one is how
much do perspectives influence

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5585-1
00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:07.846
impact? There's no answer
written for it.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5623-0
00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:12.389
So I'm gonna say it, but I I
talked to you about the various

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5623-1
00:24:12.389 --> 00:24:16.064
parameters that your manager
looks at when deciding your

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5623-2
00:24:16.064 --> 00:24:20.127
impact and we talked about the
fact that perspectives that you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5623-3
00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:23.608
worked with your peers or your
stakeholders and other

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5623-4
00:24:23.608 --> 00:24:25.156
collaborators do matter.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-0
00:24:25.856 --> 00:24:29.101
Uh, so it is an important part
of the assessment. But that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-1
00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:32.347
said, like, that's not the only
part. There are many other

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-2
00:24:32.347 --> 00:24:35.537
things that go into deciding
it's one of the elements and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-3
00:24:35.537 --> 00:24:38.838
also for that I would say and I
would repeat that because I

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-4
00:24:38.838 --> 00:24:42.413
actually said that earlier. Your
manager can essentially distill

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-5
00:24:42.413 --> 00:24:45.824
that feedback, look at it in the
context of the situation and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-6
00:24:45.824 --> 00:24:49.014
choose to interpret it and
things so that they understand

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-7
00:24:49.014 --> 00:24:52.425
in the situation in which that
may have happened because they

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-8
00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:55.890
can always situations where if
you work with ten people on all

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5723-9
00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.586
the 10 people are saying great
things about you.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5756-0
00:24:58.696 --> 00:25:01.332
Might be a specific thing that
happened, and so it's very

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5756-1
00:25:01.332 --> 00:25:03.969
important for the manager to
understand the situation and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5756-2
00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:06.696
then look at the feedback and
decide based on the situation

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5756-3
00:25:06.696 --> 00:25:07.696
that they're aware of.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5766-0
00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:14.816
All right, so now we we land at
the mids.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5774-0
00:25:15.976 --> 00:25:19.426
That that have come up with the
last few years, right?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5779-0
00:25:20.376 --> 00:25:21.726
So the first myth is that.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5797-0
00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:25.533
My minds how to balance the
budget and my rewards will be

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5797-1
00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:27.906
lower than what my manager had
recommended.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5809-0
00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:34.206
So while it is true that orgs
have to balance to a budget.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-0
00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:39.020
It's important to understand the
statistic here that 80%, if not

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-1
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.773
90 percent, 90%. In fact in our
team or more of the employees

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-2
00:25:42.773 --> 00:25:46.586
get their final rewards as per
the initial recommendation from

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-3
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:50.036
their manager. And in fact, if
the final rewards are bit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-4
00:25:50.036 --> 00:25:53.667
different, which is slightly
higher or lower and more often

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5866-5
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:56.936
than not it's higher than the
initial recommendation.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5881-0
00:25:57.926 --> 00:26:00.980
So while it's true though, so
so, so while it's true then that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5881-1
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.356
managers and the org has to
balance your budget.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5897-0
00:26:04.136 --> 00:26:07.550
Right. I I wanted to think of
the rewards as I impact lead

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5897-1
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.386
discussion as opposed to budget
lead discussion.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5899-0
00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:11.616
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5903-0
00:26:12.806 --> 00:26:13.916
Second, Amit is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5940-0
00:26:14.626 --> 00:26:17.702
If I can leave of absence, it's
not possibly get high. It was

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5940-1
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:20.977
already spoken about this. It is
possible it just it just depends

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5940-2
00:26:20.977 --> 00:26:24.004
on the period you are working
actively in the team. I wasn't

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5940-3
00:26:24.004 --> 00:26:26.386
going to again because of
already discussed it.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5946-0
00:26:28.276 --> 00:26:29.346
The third myth is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5956-0
00:26:30.056 --> 00:26:33.446
There was allocated based on
predetermined distribution.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5970-0
00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:38.741
And employees are competing for
a slot in a particular rewards

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/5970-1
00:26:38.741 --> 00:26:39.236
bucket.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6008-0
00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:44.016
Puneet touched upon this in the
beginning of his of his section,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6008-1
00:26:44.016 --> 00:26:47.616
right, which is that they used
to be a time when we used to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6008-2
00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:51.216
have a bell curve requirement
for all the employees and him

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6008-3
00:26:51.216 --> 00:26:54.996
that time is gone. It's there's
now no requirement to have any

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6008-4
00:26:54.996 --> 00:26:57.696
period determined distribution
for any team.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6032-0
00:26:58.556 --> 00:27:01.777
Right. Two, two things to note
though. So why so we do have to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6032-1
00:27:01.777 --> 00:27:04.742
balance the budget at the org
level and there's a need to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6032-2
00:27:04.742 --> 00:27:07.657
differentiate the need to
differentiate doesn't go away.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6032-3
00:27:07.657 --> 00:27:08.526
We still want to.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6051-0
00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:13.985
Reward people with higher awards
for higher impact and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6051-1
00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:17.806
differentiate higher impact from
less high from lower impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6085-0
00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:23.307
But but there is no fixed
distribution required by the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6085-1
00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:27.833
team anymore, OK? And the last
myth on this page is actually

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6085-2
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:32.508
get higher rewards because I've
worked more as a result of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6085-3
00:27:32.508 --> 00:27:33.176
pandemic.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6106-0
00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:40.813
I I at this point is important
to again differentiate between

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6106-1
00:27:40.813 --> 00:27:44.826
impact and activity. K impact
determines reward.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6136-0
00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:49.269
Activity does not determine
reward activity if done smartly,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6136-1
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:53.033
can determine impact and then
impact can determine reward. But

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6136-2
00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:56.139
activity directly does not
impact reward, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6136-3
00:27:56.139 --> 00:27:56.736
therefore.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6147-0
00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:01.536
Going back to the basics, higher
impact determines higher reward.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6153-0
00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:05.256
So those the myths that.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6162-0
00:28:06.296 --> 00:28:09.306
We'll have that that HR has has
collected over the years.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6173-0
00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:14.686
And the facts which which
correspond to the Mets.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6202-0
00:28:16.406 --> 00:28:20.189
Umm, any any questions on the on
the chat party? No, no questions

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6202-1
00:28:20.189 --> 00:28:23.685
yet. Great. So the last last
part of our of our presentation

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6202-2
00:28:23.685 --> 00:28:27.296
is the key take away. This is
short part just to wrap up, yes.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6207-0
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.526
Like so.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6210-0
00:28:35.116 --> 00:28:35.526
Customer.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6214-0
00:28:42.406 --> 00:28:44.376
Sure. So.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6234-0
00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:50.026
So the there are two aspects of
rewards. One is a promos and the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6234-1
00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:54.466
other is their annual rewards,
right? The promos are basically.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6259-0
00:28:55.786 --> 00:29:00.676
People are eligible for promo if
they are, if they are working at

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6259-1
00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:05.565
a level consistent with the next
level for a consistent amount of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6259-2
00:29:05.565 --> 00:29:05.936
time.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6270-0
00:29:06.646 --> 00:29:10.266
Right. And and these promos
happened twice here, meteor or

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6270-1
00:29:10.266 --> 00:29:11.186
animal rewards?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6272-0
00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:12.266
Right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6316-0
00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:17.323
The promos have a higher the the
the need for consistency in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6316-1
00:29:17.323 --> 00:29:21.548
promos can span across years for
the higher levels, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6316-2
00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:25.910
rewards is one year, one reward,
but promos for the high levels

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6316-3
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.386
need consistency to be able to
save this person's.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6344-0
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:34.061
Uh consistently working at the
next level and that period can

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6344-1
00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:37.999
can require to be more than one
year at the high levels, right?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6344-2
00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:41.322
So that's a promo eligibility
model. Does it answer a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6344-3
00:29:41.322 --> 00:29:41.876
question?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6346-0
00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:43.256
Great.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6348-0
00:29:44.756 --> 00:29:45.266
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6350-0
00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:48.146
Yes.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6354-0
00:29:50.006 --> 00:29:50.926
Yes, but at least.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6364-0
00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:55.226
Yeah, just adding on to the last
question.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6378-0
00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:59.956
What do you exactly mean when
you say higher levels?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6408-0
00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:08.421
High level? Sure. So, so. So the
entry levels is level 59. Pranay

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6408-1
00:30:08.421 --> 00:30:14.334
high levels are you know, 6160
two 6364, sixty 67 whatever

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6408-2
00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:15.236
right 68.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-0
00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:19.196
Uh, and and as you go higher as
as you go high in the level,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-1
00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:22.865
they need to have to the the,
the the bar for promo becomes

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-2
00:30:22.865 --> 00:30:26.656
higher right? So to to get a
promo at a higher level you need

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-3
00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:30.324
to be able to perform at the
high level for a longer period

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-4
00:30:30.324 --> 00:30:34.238
of time as opposed to a promo at
a lower level. That's what I'm

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6461-5
00:30:34.238 --> 00:30:34.666
in for.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6465-0
00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:38.036
As the answer question.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6469-0
00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:39.786
A uh. Kind of.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6471-0
00:30:40.466 --> 00:30:40.856
Great.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6474-0
00:30:41.536 --> 00:30:41.896
Thank you.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6483-0
00:30:46.046 --> 00:30:49.056
So let me wrap up with the key
takeaways here, right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6510-0
00:30:49.826 --> 00:30:53.903
The the key take away for you to
understand is that performance

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6510-1
00:30:53.903 --> 00:30:57.471
and development and annual
rewards are two sides of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6510-2
00:30:57.471 --> 00:31:01.166
same coin. That's the main
baseline for the stock, right?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6515-0
00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:04.076
You can I and.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6530-0
00:31:04.206 --> 00:31:08.203
Ohh but performance and
development is an ongoing year

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6530-1
00:31:08.203 --> 00:31:11.256
round process where impact
drives reward.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6537-0
00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:14.536
The the key aspects of PND are.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6548-0
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:18.806
Business impact feedback and
rewards.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6558-0
00:31:20.686 --> 00:31:24.656
Feedback. The tools are connects
101's perspectives.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6604-0
00:31:25.396 --> 00:31:28.796
But it was the tools are
promotions and animal rewards.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6604-1
00:31:28.796 --> 00:31:32.682
The impact is determined whether
by the three circles of impact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6604-2
00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:35.535
your own individual
contribution, how you help

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6604-3
00:31:35.535 --> 00:31:39.421
others succeed, and how you can
leverage the work for others in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6604-4
00:31:39.421 --> 00:31:42.396
your own work. So that's the
summary of P&amp;D.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6606-0
00:31:43.516 --> 00:31:43.986
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6622-0
00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:49.069
And then as an employee, you can
influence annual rewards by

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6622-1
00:31:49.069 --> 00:31:51.456
influencing the what and the
how.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6651-0
00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:54.875
We can influence the what by
aligning with Amazon

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6651-1
00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:58.155
expectations through those same
tools we spoke about earlier

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6651-2
00:31:58.155 --> 00:31:59.876
connects one on ones, et cetera.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6672-0
00:32:00.606 --> 00:32:04.052
Align with the manager on what
it means to exceed expectations,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6672-1
00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:07.445
and then look for opportunities
to achieve that to the various

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6672-2
00:32:07.445 --> 00:32:08.576
circles of influence.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6686-0
00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:13.992
And then you can control how
that impact is delivered by

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6686-1
00:32:13.992 --> 00:32:16.926
demonstrating the Microsoft
cultural values.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6703-0
00:32:17.646 --> 00:32:20.685
By searching and asking for
feedback to continuously fine

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6703-1
00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:23.776
tune the way you work and to
learn and grow along the way.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6719-0
00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:27.492
Under my actively seeking
opportunities to leverage others

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6719-1
00:32:27.492 --> 00:32:29.406
and contribute to other other
success.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6731-0
00:32:30.366 --> 00:32:34.707
Right. So that's that's a
summary of of the annual reports

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6731-1
00:32:34.707 --> 00:32:35.296
process.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6754-0
00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:41.268
I with this we had done. The
next steps are we have some

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6754-1
00:32:41.268 --> 00:32:44.973
links over here some some
resources for you. We have an

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6754-2
00:32:44.973 --> 00:32:45.966
employee guide.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6807-0
00:32:46.636 --> 00:32:49.654
Is an online training in terms
of what it means to understand

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6807-1
00:32:49.654 --> 00:32:52.673
annual rewards. You know I'll we
will share the deck with you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6807-2
00:32:52.673 --> 00:32:55.789
after this talk. So please feel
free to please please feel free

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6807-3
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:58.613
to go to these links if you
invested and and of course we

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6807-4
00:32:58.613 --> 00:33:01.096
have ask HR for any questions
that you might have.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6809-0
00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:04.866
Questions.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6811-0
00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:09.996
Sure.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6813-0
00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:13.916
This.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6822-0
00:33:17.356 --> 00:33:19.566
How can I find what is the
target reward?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6826-0
00:33:24.326 --> 00:33:25.676
Yeah, the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6839-0
00:33:26.826 --> 00:33:30.216
The target reward at each level
is that confidential, Puneet.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6881-0
00:33:31.356 --> 00:33:35.572
I was actually documented on SL
web and come on there still

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6881-1
00:33:35.572 --> 00:33:39.928
there right? So that range for
your level is mentioned in the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6881-2
00:33:39.928 --> 00:33:44.144
total rewards page for each
person. The stock range as well

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6881-3
00:33:44.144 --> 00:33:44.636
as the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-0
00:33:47.646 --> 00:33:52.494
Ohh, so this talks range for a
given level for a given person.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-1
00:33:52.494 --> 00:33:56.649
Is mentioned on the total
rewards page when you go to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-2
00:33:56.649 --> 00:34:00.804
total rewards page like
somewhere at the bottom it it

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-3
00:34:00.804 --> 00:34:05.883
mentions the stock range as well
as bonus percentage range. Merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-4
00:34:05.883 --> 00:34:10.269
however, is like every year it
is determined on basis of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-5
00:34:10.269 --> 00:34:14.656
several factors and that
information as far as I know is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6947-6
00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:15.656
never shared.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6970-0
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:19.361
Broadly, I think it is your
discussion with your manager

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6970-1
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:22.798
which can give you idea whether
you are getting it in the middle

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6970-2
00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:23.486
of the range.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6978-0
00:34:23.856 --> 00:34:27.146
Ohh and it is always aligned
with the impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/6983-0
00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:33.076
Well, that's.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7017-0
00:34:41.486 --> 00:34:43.938
Next one is from Ajay. I
understand it's one year one

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7017-1
00:34:43.938 --> 00:34:46.889
reward, some of the initiatives,
some longer just station period

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7017-2
00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.386
specifically building something
from scratch and then?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7020-0
00:34:49.496 --> 00:34:49.786
I've been.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7025-0
00:34:52.416 --> 00:34:52.966
Thanks dear.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-0
00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:58.694
Great question. So, so it's uh,
the key again is to align with

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-1
00:34:58.694 --> 00:35:01.888
your expectations for your
manager, right? There are it's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-2
00:35:01.888 --> 00:35:05.301
it's important to understand
what constitutes success for the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-3
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:08.329
work you're doing within that
one year. In the case of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-4
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:11.522
projects that span across
multiple years, right, it's not

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-5
00:35:11.522 --> 00:35:14.716
reasonable to expect that
customers will adopt, will have

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-6
00:35:14.716 --> 00:35:18.074
massive adoption and that's
access to the first year. So the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-7
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:21.543
new align with the manager and
what success means in the first

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7094-8
00:35:21.543 --> 00:35:24.736
year, it could be that you hit
some milestone longer way.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7126-0
00:35:25.136 --> 00:35:28.244
We're able to prove some
successes along the way, right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7126-1
00:35:28.244 --> 00:35:31.680
It's it's very it's it's fairly
unlikely and haven't seen this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7126-2
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.897
happen in the past where you
have one year of work with no

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7126-3
00:35:34.897 --> 00:35:36.806
checks and balances along the
way.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7159-0
00:35:37.776 --> 00:35:41.252
Right. So then aligning with a
man on what those checks and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7159-1
00:35:41.252 --> 00:35:44.669
balances are and how to define
success at those checks and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7159-2
00:35:44.669 --> 00:35:48.087
balance checkpoints would be the
way by which you would be

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7159-3
00:35:48.087 --> 00:35:50.636
evaluated on your impact for
that one year?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7170-0
00:35:53.506 --> 00:35:56.086
So I think Ajay, on this one,
one additional thing is.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-0
00:35:56.726 --> 00:35:59.921
I mean, very often industry
impact is looked at as like

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-1
00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:03.515
landed impact versus you know
everything else which could also

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-2
00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:06.995
be impacted. And so in cases
like the one that you're saying

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-3
00:36:06.995 --> 00:36:10.532
where your landed impact may
happen maybe even the next year,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-4
00:36:10.532 --> 00:36:13.841
but you spent almost all of the
year working on that. The

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-5
00:36:13.841 --> 00:36:17.492
company is not looking at landed
Deepak at all the times right.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-6
00:36:17.492 --> 00:36:20.801
There are many other ways in
which you could have created

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-7
00:36:20.801 --> 00:36:24.396
impact as interim milestones and
those are all absolutely fine

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7270-8
00:36:24.396 --> 00:36:26.906
and great logical things for us
to look at.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-0
00:36:26.986 --> 00:36:30.031
I I mean example is like you
know your your working on this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-1
00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:33.228
this mega consumer feature and
you've almost spent eight to 10

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-2
00:36:33.228 --> 00:36:35.817
months you've done a lot of user
research, testing

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-3
00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:39.116
experimentation but the feature
hasn't shipped right. It's gonna

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-4
00:36:39.116 --> 00:36:42.364
ship next year. So it's not like
the reverse process is waiting

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-5
00:36:42.364 --> 00:36:45.256
really for the feature to ship
and see how customers are

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-6
00:36:45.256 --> 00:36:48.200
adopting it to say OK Now I'm
going to measure impact but

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-7
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.042
there are a lot of other
intermediate impact milestones

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-8
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:54.138
that you would have in terms of
the insights that you got in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-9
00:36:54.138 --> 00:36:56.879
terms of the way you build
experiments for what those

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7359-10
00:36:56.879 --> 00:36:58.046
experiments led you to.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7365-0
00:36:58.236 --> 00:37:00.826
And so all of those are also
contributing to your impact.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7381-0
00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:07.247
I say one other perspective on
this Ajay. Right now the impact

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7381-1
00:37:07.247 --> 00:37:09.616
for the other is determined by
looking at.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7392-0
00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:13.296
What you've delivered against
what the opportunity was.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7401-0
00:37:14.086 --> 00:37:17.136
Right. So if if in that year the
opportunity?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7439-0
00:37:18.286 --> 00:37:22.613
Was that you would be able to
hit, you know, some mini interim

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7439-1
00:37:22.613 --> 00:37:26.871
milestone three but not ship
then that's your expectation and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7439-2
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:31.060
then what have you delivered
against this opportunity is how

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7439-3
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.250
you would be evaluated if the
opportunity was that you would

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7439-4
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.486
ship this feature?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-0
00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:41.196
But then, for whatever reason,
it didn't get shipped. Then once

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-1
00:37:41.196 --> 00:37:45.127
again it would be up to you in a
managed to figure out that was

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-2
00:37:45.127 --> 00:37:48.688
the opportunity properly
evaluated. Should we recalculate

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-3
00:37:48.688 --> 00:37:52.250
the opportunity? If not, then
you then you rewarded on an

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-4
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:56.119
impact against your opportunity
so that it's very important to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-5
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:59.927
is just another way of saying
that a line on expectations and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7504-6
00:37:59.927 --> 00:38:02.936
your impact is determined based
on expectations.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7506-0
00:38:03.536 --> 00:38:03.806
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7508-0
00:38:05.696 --> 00:38:06.336
Great question.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7518-0
00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:11.406
Mentioned doubling the salary
budget.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7520-0
00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:13.466
Acting the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7533-0
00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:17.361
Yes, this is a classic question
that we've been getting for the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7533-1
00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:18.316
last several months now.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7537-0
00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.236
It's both of us to answer that.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-0
00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:28.376
OK, so let me go first. Alright.
Sathya mentioned that the merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-1
00:38:28.376 --> 00:38:31.789
budgets being doubled. Merit
budget includes a bunch of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-2
00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:35.018
things. Let me just go over
them, right. It includes

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-3
00:38:35.018 --> 00:38:38.674
increase in salary. It doesn't.
It doesn't mean that salary

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-4
00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:42.513
salary is being doubled. Please
understand that it means merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-5
00:38:42.513 --> 00:38:46.412
is being doubled. Right. So the
first to note is that the merit

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-6
00:38:46.412 --> 00:38:49.947
is being doubled from Microsoft
across entire company and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7612-7
00:38:49.947 --> 00:38:50.556
different.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-0
00:38:50.626 --> 00:38:54.355
Countries have different
increases of merit based on

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-1
00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:58.646
their requirements. OK, India
actually increase the merit of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-2
00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:02.586
all the employees last two
years, so third year now. So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-3
00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:07.018
sorry increase in 2020-2021 and
this year again is increasing,

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-4
00:39:07.018 --> 00:39:11.169
right. But given the increase
that you had in the last two

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-5
00:39:11.169 --> 00:39:15.672
years, will the merit increase
in India be double? Probably not

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-6
00:39:15.672 --> 00:39:19.893
as per HR? The answer is no, it
will be less than double OK

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7688-7
00:39:19.893 --> 00:39:20.526
secondly.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7700-0
00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:24.167
The the minute budget includes
has a bunch of different

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7700-1
00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:25.196
components to it.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7718-0
00:39:25.836 --> 00:39:29.256
It it it includes salary and
salary will be increased this

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7718-1
00:39:29.256 --> 00:39:31.806
year significantly, but not
nearly doubled.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7744-0
00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:36.966
It includes bonus. It includes
promo budget. So we've we've got

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7744-1
00:39:36.966 --> 00:39:41.306
larger promo budgets this year
and includes stock was we have

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7744-2
00:39:41.306 --> 00:39:42.706
larger stock ranges.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7782-0
00:39:43.366 --> 00:39:47.898
And includes SSA's special stock
awards. There's a larger budget

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7782-1
00:39:47.898 --> 00:39:51.734
of special stock awards
happening this year, right? So

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7782-2
00:39:51.734 --> 00:39:55.917
across the companies spend on
all these various components.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7782-3
00:39:55.917 --> 00:39:58.916
The company spend is being
doubled, right?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7810-0
00:40:00.216 --> 00:40:03.461
Again, it doesn't mean that
every comment would be doubled.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7810-1
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:06.761
It doesn't even mean that even
one will be doubled. It means

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7810-2
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:10.223
it'll all be increased in some
ratio, whether overall Microsoft

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7810-3
00:40:10.223 --> 00:40:11.846
merit budget is being doubled.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-0
00:40:15.236 --> 00:40:18.309
I think you've already said it.
Just the one thing because you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-1
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:21.188
said this, but the question was
framed like, you know, the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-2
00:40:21.188 --> 00:40:24.018
salary being doubled. So please
don't go by what the news

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-3
00:40:24.018 --> 00:40:26.945
agencies right, like, go with
the official text or WhatsApp

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-4
00:40:26.945 --> 00:40:30.067
test and turn those salaries are
not being delivered. It was if

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-5
00:40:30.067 --> 00:40:33.238
you read the mail, it was about
the merit increase that Abhishek

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-6
00:40:33.238 --> 00:40:36.117
was talking about that string
and then the whole aspect of

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7872-7
00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:38.166
various geographies and how that
applies.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7874-0
00:40:43.906 --> 00:40:44.296
That's it.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7898-0
00:40:45.896 --> 00:40:51.410
S stands for Special stock award
K Specialist Stock award is is

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7898-1
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.718
is given as a way to
differentiate employees with

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7898-2
00:40:55.718 --> 00:40:57.786
high impact as a way to.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7921-0
00:40:58.476 --> 00:41:01.807
Make sure that they understand
the system really appreciates

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7921-1
00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:05.029
the impact they have and they
have they've they've had a a

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7921-2
00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.776
material impact on the business.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7943-0
00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:13.677
Duration to the annual stock
award. Yes, it's in addition to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7943-1
00:41:13.677 --> 00:41:17.952
the annual stock well it it it.
Please know that it's it doesn't

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7943-2
00:41:17.952 --> 00:41:19.596
it's it's very selective.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7949-0
00:41:20.386 --> 00:41:22.116
Right. And it's it, yeah.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7953-0
00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:35.986
From the.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7958-0
00:41:39.586 --> 00:41:41.176
Sure, my understanding of it.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7995-0
00:41:45.866 --> 00:41:49.649
I just wanted to kind of double
click on the meeting grades and

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7995-1
00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:53.372
just share my understanding and
you one of you can correct me.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7995-2
00:41:53.372 --> 00:41:56.682
Yeah, uh there. So merit
increase has an aspects of the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/7995-3
00:41:56.682 --> 00:41:57.096
market.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-0
00:41:57.826 --> 00:42:01.310
Right against the market where
we fail, where we fair as an

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-1
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.911
organization, that's one aspect.
The impact is there and then

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-2
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:08.105
where the individual is
positioned right in general in

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-3
00:42:08.105 --> 00:42:11.764
that particular level. So there
are three to four factors that

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-4
00:42:11.764 --> 00:42:15.191
goes into in determining the
merit increase and most often

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-5
00:42:15.191 --> 00:42:18.791
like all these factors in the
sense like the calculation, the

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-6
00:42:18.791 --> 00:42:22.334
real formula that gets applied,
even managers and my opinion

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-7
00:42:22.334 --> 00:42:25.644
even Lt is not aware of it, but
these are the code, poor

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8075-8
00:42:25.644 --> 00:42:28.316
considerations that goes into
merit increase.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-0
00:42:28.556 --> 00:42:31.675
The translates in what you'll
see directly. What you would see

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-1
00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:34.497
otherwise is essentially the
bonus aspects and the stock

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-2
00:42:34.497 --> 00:42:37.022
ranges, and in general manager
and from Kathleen's

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-3

communication the the stock
range has went up the last two

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-4
00:42:39.943 --> 00:42:42.963
years, not just this year but
the previous year as well. But

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-5
00:42:42.963 --> 00:42:45.884
just wanted to kind of share my
understanding with many to

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-6
00:42:45.884 --> 00:42:48.854
increase and please feel free to
correct or absolutely 100%

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8135-7
00:42:48.854 --> 00:42:49.696
correct, correct.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8137-0
00:42:52.506 --> 00:42:53.016
You.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8145-0
00:42:55.056 --> 00:42:57.246
Any more questions in the room
are on the chat.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8152-0
00:42:58.406 --> 00:43:00.066
Basically question on behalf of
when you try.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8154-0
00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:01.206
Yeah.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8156-0
00:43:01.556 --> 00:43:01.786
OK.

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8184-0
00:43:05.226 --> 00:43:08.950
Can you share the timelines or
inputs on like people who joined

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8184-1
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:12.267
like Jan to April March this
year or folks at joint post

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8184-2
00:43:12.267 --> 00:43:15.176
April 1st, how does the whole
rewards thing work?

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8255-0
00:43:18.156 --> 00:43:21.777
Both April 1st people aren't
eligible, right? Yes. So April

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8255-1
00:43:21.777 --> 00:43:25.640
1st and April 1st is basically
the cut off date, which means if

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8255-2
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.201
you join on April 1st on Fools
Day or after that, then you

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8255-3
00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:32.762
basically not eligible for
rewards in that year cycle. But

6cef69f0-54bb-418c-9d30-8cb075442ec3/8255-4
