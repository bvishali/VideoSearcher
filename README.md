# VideoSearcher
Problem – For getting our queries resolved, many a times we refer to recorded videos, lectures etc. with runtime in hours while actuals answer might just be in a small clip of few seconds or minutes.  Scenario- Starting from on-boarding to day-to-day life, we @ MSFT go through tens of video lectures but later while applying the learning, we might have to re-visit the videos for our queries.  Hack – A FAQ Bot can be used to parse the transcript and answer the query along with pointing to the timestamps in video where the probability of answering the query is high.  Target Product- Viva Learning, MS Teams
